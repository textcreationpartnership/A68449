            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

But trulie this Goſpell which <hi>John</hi> brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth, is nothing elſe, than a teſtimonie of Chriſt Ieſus: that is to ſay, that Chriſt is the ſonne of God, the life of men, the light of the worlde, the breade of life which came downe from heauen, the reſurrection, the waye, the trueth, and the life, the good Shephearde of the sheepe, and to be short, the onelie ſauiour of the worlde.

Chapter maketh mention, aptly therfore he calleth this hiſtory the Goſpel, for he doth more largely and plainelie ſet forth the diuinity of Chriſt, and the miſtery of our redemption, than the other Euangeliſts. The which thing being for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeene by our Lord and Sauiour Chriſt, called this our Euangeliſt, and his brother alſo, the ſonne of <hi>Thunder,</hi> or as <hi>Marke</hi> hath, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>.

And to be short, all of them ſeking to ſet forth Chriſt, the firſt three namely <hi>Mathew, Marke,</hi> and <hi>Luke,</hi> do ſet before vs (If I may ſo ſpeake) the bodye, but <hi>Iohn</hi> the ſoule. Inſomuch, that this Goſpell maye truelie be called the key which openeth the doore to come to the vnderſtanding of the other three. For who ſoeuer shall attaine to the knowledge of Gods power, the which is here cunninglie expreſſed, he at the length shall reade with profite that which the other Euangeliſtes haue written as concerning the redeemer. Neyther was it done without the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:14631:4"/>
ſinguler counſell of the holie Ghoſt, that the Goſpell written by <hi>Mathew, Marke,</hi> and <hi>Luke,</hi> shoulde be published and ſet foorth in the worlde, before that which was written by <hi>Iohn:</hi> for the weake eares of the faithfull were not capeable of ſo great thunder. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was conuenient that the Incarnation of Chriſt shoulde fyrſt of all be ſet foorth, his Natiuitie deſcribed, and howe according to the ſcriptures he was borne of the ſeede of <hi>Abraham,</hi> of the tribe of <hi>Iuda,</hi> and of the ſtocke of <hi>Dauid,</hi> by what documents he prooued him ſelfe to be the true <hi>Meſſias,</hi> how according to the ſcriptures he ſuffered, and was bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, and roſe againe the thirde daye, and shewed himſelfe aliue againe to his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, after that aſcending into the heauens, that ſo fayth increaſing by little and litle, there might be a way made to receyue the more hie documents of the diuinitie of Chriſt. But there be manie that thinke that <hi>John</hi> was ſpeciallie led to wirte to this ende and purpoſe, namelie that he might defende the diuinitie of Chriſt, againſt the wicked blaſphemyes of <hi>Ebion, Cerinthus,</hi> and <hi>Carpocrates.</hi> But what ſoeuer occaſion hee had then to write, there is notwithſtanding no doubt, but that GOD had a farther regarde to his Churche. He did therefore ſo guide the pen of the Euangeliſt to write, that the partes being deuided amongſt them, he might bring the whole bodie to a perfect worke. And whereas they haue placed <hi>John</hi> in the fourth ſeate, it was done vpon the conſideration of the time in the which hee wrote, namelie when he was in exile, or when hee was called backe againe (as ſome affirme) from the death of <hi>Domitian.</hi>

               <p>Becauſe the Euangeliſt had ſayde: <hi>In the beginning was the worde,</hi> (that is to ſaye, before the worlde was, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore any thing was made, when thinges were nowe readye to haue theyr be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, yea, before all theſe thinges was the word) it followed that hée ſhould ſhewe where it was.

                  <hi>Iohn</hi> therefore putteth a difference betwéene this worde and all other thinges created, and doth alſo at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute vnto him, a diſtinct ſubſtaunce from the father. For the Euangeliſt ſhould haue abſurdelye ſayde that he had béene alwayes with GOD, except he had had a certaine proper ſubſiſting in God.</p>
               <p>Therfore this place is of great force to confute the error of <hi>Sabellius,</hi> becauſe hée ſheweth that the ſonne doth differ from the father. Wherefore although men ought to ſpeake ſoberlye and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtlye of ſo great miſteries and ſecrete thinges yet notwithſtanding, the aunſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent writers of the Churche are worthie to be excuſed, who, when they coulde no otherwiſe defende the true and ſincere doctrine, againſt the double and deceyt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full wordes of Heritiques, were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrayned to deuiſe and inuent certayne woordes, the which notwithſtanding ſhoulde ſounde or ſignifie no other thing than that which was already put downe in the ſacred Scriptures.

The which ſeparation,<note place="margin">Math. 28</note> Chriſt alſo confirmeth in theſe wordes, <hi>Goe yee foorth and teache all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, of the Sonne, and of the holy Ghoſt.</hi> And Saint <hi>Iohn,</hi>

For whatſoeuer was not made in the beginning, but had his being before, and was alſo with God, the ſame is God. But Chriſt the worde of God was in the beginning with GOD, therefore he is God. For how ſhoulde he not be GOD, which is the wiſedome of God, the worde of God, the vertue, the power of God, and the Sonne of God? Howe ſhoulde he not be God, which is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlaſting, hauing neyther beginning nor ende of dayes? How ſhoulde he not be God, which was alwayes with God, and ſhall be for euer? <hi>C.</hi> Leaſt any man therefore ſhoulde remaine ſcrupulous or doubtfull of the deuine eſſence of God, Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> plainely affirmeth that he is God. Now ſéeing there is one God, it fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth that Chriſt is one eſſence with the father, and yet notwithſtanding that they differ in ſomething. <hi>R.</hi> For the Father imprinteth the Image. The ſonne is the Image imprinted or expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. The father ſhineth, and the worde is the very ſame brightneſſe which doth ſhine. <hi>M.</hi> Wherefore we muſt not feare leſt the Euangeliſt ſhall appoint a newe God vnto vs, againſt the law of God, in the which it is ſayde,<note place="margin">Pſal. 81</note> 
                  <hi>Thou shalt haue no newe God.</hi> He cannot bée God which is not equall with God in ſempi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity. It is written: There is no God before me, neither is there any after me. If this word be ſprong foorth after God, it cannot be God. But the Euangeliſt taketh awaye this feare from vs, ſéeing he ſaieth not: And that word was made God, <hi>But the worde was God.</hi> Not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe afterward it ceaſſed to be God. God forbid. How had that béene God, which coulde afterward ceaſſe to be God? But to the ende he might expreſſe the euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting diuinitie of the worde of God, the which hath no beginning, he ſayde, <hi>and God was the worde:</hi> That is to ſaye, In the beginning, before the worlde was made, before all times, this worde was God. <hi>A.</hi> But this confeſſion of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian fayth by occaſion, was the cauſe of manye perſecutions. For when the worlde coulde not attaine to knowe by carnall wiſdome, howe God woulde be manifeſted in the fleſhe, it perſecuted the Apoſtles and Martires of Chriſt to the death, becauſe they ſéemed to affirme the pluralitie of Goddes, when as they with great conſtancie of minde affirmed that to be true, whiche this our Euangeliſt hath here put downe by plaine wordes, namely, God is the worde.

                  <hi>M.</hi> The Euangeliſt repeateth thoſe thinges which he ſpake euen now, but ſo that he ioyneth together thoſe thinges which were ſpoken ſeuerally.

and by coeternall, or of like eternitye with God, which was ſomewhat before the worde. Therfore he repeateth this, that the ſame was in the beginning with GOD, aſcribing vnto him the like ſempiternitie with GOD. <hi>C.</hi> And ſo thoſe two former partes are gathered by him into a ſhort concluſion, that he was alwaies and that with God: to the ende we might vnderſtande the beginning to be before all time. Nowe wée ſée with how fewe wordes (notwithſtanding cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpectlie and Godlye) the Euangeliſt hath handled the miſtery of the diuinity: the which thing if the Chriſtians of olde time would haue followed, the churches had not beene ſo miſerablie and daunge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſlye deuided, neyther ſhoulde they haue geuen occaſion to the ſubtil and bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie aduerſaries,<note place="margin">1.

thereby gather, that after the worlde was created, and all thinges therein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayned, GOD doth make nothing anye more by his worde, but doth ſuffer all things to be done by chaunſe, and is as it werein the meane time ydle or a ſléepe: God forbid. For thoſe thinges whiche hée made by his worde, hée gouerneth and preſerueth with his euerlaſting pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence: as teſtifieth our Sauiour Chriſt him ſelfe,<note place="margin">Iohn. 5</note> ſaying, <hi>My Father worketh hitherto, and I worke.</hi> And the Apoſtle <hi>Paule:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Cor. 12 Gen. 2</note> 
                  <hi>VVhich worketh all in all.</hi> For in that he is ſayde to reſt the Seuenth daye from all his worke, it is no otherwiſe to bée vnderſtoode, than that he ceaſſed from the creation of the Heauen and Earth, which we ſée, not that hée lefte of to gouerne the ſame, and to preſerue it. <hi>For hee beareth vp all thinges by his migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tye worde.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Heb. 1</note> The which thing ought to bring no ſmall conſolation to the mindes of the Godly. For ſo they learne to reſt &amp; ſtay them ſelues on Gods prouidence, without the which not ſo much as one héere of their heade can periſhe.<note place="margin">Luke. 21</note> 
                  <hi>R.</hi> For hée which féeleth by faith, that all thinges depende vpon God, he beléeueth alſo that he falleth into the handes of God, when he forſaketh al thinges, and entereth into death. <hi>A.</hi> We are alſo here admoniſhed that theyr opinion is peruerſe and wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, which thinke this worlde to be euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting. We learne hereby alſo that the Sonne of God was neyther made nor created, ſéeing by him all thinges were made as ſayth our Euangeliſt.</p>
               <q>And without it was made nothing that was made.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>R.</hi> This is an expoſition of the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence going before: For all thinges were ſo made by the worde, that without the ſame there was no creature made. Now if all thinges were made by the worde, it followeth then that the worde was not made. Wherefore the worde is God, and not a creature as <hi>Arrian</hi> dreameth.</p>
               <p>And becauſe Satan goeth verye much about to derrogate the glory of Chriſt, it ſéemed good to the Euangeliſt, preciſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye to affirme, that of all thinges that were created, none ought to be excepted. <hi>A.</hi> For God created all thinges by his ſonne chriſt. <hi>M.</hi> But we muſt not thinke that as one Idle hée made all things by his worde, as by his ſeruaunt, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vppon to gather that Chriſt is leſſe then the Father: God forbid. For he made al thinges by his worde, not as by a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunt, but as it were by his wiſedome and power. Neyther muſt we thinke that the Father being vnable of him ſelfe to make and create, did ſet his ſonne to finiſhe this worke: God fobid. For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it be written, that he made all things by his worde, that is to ſay, by his onely begotten ſonne, yet the Father is not therby excluded from the worke, nor made vnable, but is ioyned to the ſonne, both in omnipotencye, in glory, and in all other thinges.</p>
               <p>Therefore this place admoniſheth vs, that ſo often as wée beholde the heauen, the earth, the Sea, and al thinges in them contayned, we ſhould conſider the omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potencye of God in them, waying in our mindes that all theſe thinges were made without any labour, without any paine, without any difficultye, without any other helpes: by the worde onelye.</p>
               <p>By this conſideration, the faithful may very much comfort them ſelues, and may arme theyr mindes with this faith a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all the enemies of God: For when they conſider the ſinguler omnipotencye of God in this, that by the power of his worde hée made all thinges, they are taught that there is nothing harde or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible vnto God, to be done, which with his word onlye can make all thinges.</p>
               <p>But wée muſt take héede that wée thinke not thoſe thinges onely which are profitable and ſéeme in our iudgement to be the beſt, to be made of GOD by Chriſt, and not the other alſo which we haue in ſmall reputacion, or thinke to be hurtfull. <hi>AVG.</hi> He made all thinges from the Aungell to the worme that cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth on the grounde. <hi>M.</hi> There be many thinges in the Creatures of God, of the which we are ignoraunt, and for that cauſe to the vnſkilfull they ſéeme to be good for nothing. There be many thinges which are iudged of vs to be hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:14631:7"/>
as Serpentes, Woolues, and ſuche kinde of wilde Beaſtes, and therefore they are thought not to be made of God. But we muſt thus thinke, that God hath created nothing without great wiſedom, and ſpeciall conſideration. If we be hurt with the Creatures, as with Beaſtes, with Water, with Fyre, with Windes, we muſt not blame the maker, but our ſinnes, and the naturall pride which is in vs, to tame and bring vnder the whiche, Flyes, Lyce, Fleas, Woormes, and ſuch lyke were created. The which we maye beholde in <hi>Pharao, Herode,</hi> and in others which were eaten with Lice &amp; woormes. <hi>A.</hi> Therefore the woorde of God is the aucthour of all thinges.</p>

               <p>Hitherto the Euangeliſt hath taught that all thinges were made by the worde: and now he attributeth the conſeruation alſo of thoſe thinges whiche are created vnto the ſame: as if he ſhoulde ſaye, that not onelye his ſodaine power and vertue which by &amp; by paſſed awaye, appeared in the creation of the world: but alſo is eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to be ſéene in this that the order of nature abideth ſtable and firme.

For what thinges ſoeuer are made by him, haue theyr life from no other than from him.

and maketh aliue,<note place="margin">Iohn. 5.</note> euen ſo the Sonne alſo quickeneth whom he will. And in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place S. <hi>Iohn</hi> ſayth:<note place="margin">1. Epiſt. 1.</note>

               <q>And the life was the light of men. AVG.</q>
               <p>By the light men are lightened, but Beaſtes are not lightened thereby, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they haue not mindes capeable of reaſon and wiſedome: but man which is made after the Image of God, hath a reaſonable minde, by the which he can perceyue and vnderſtand wiſedome.</p>
               <p>Therfore that life by which all thinges are made, is the light, and not of all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, but of men onely. <hi>M.</hi> So that the Euangeliſt meaneth not that light, by this worde light, which pertaineth to the Sonne, and doeth lighten the eyes of our body, but he meaneth that light, by the which the eyes of our minde are illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated to knowe God. And he maketh mention of that part of life, by the which men excell all other liuing Creatures: As if he ſhould ſaye, that not a common kinde of life was giuen vnto men, but ſuch a life as is ioyned with the light of vnderſtanding.</p>
               <p>And he ſeparateth man from the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of all other creatures, becauſe we perceaue better the power of God in vs by ſence, than we behold the ſame a farre of. So Saint <hi>Paul</hi> teacheth that God is not to be ſought a farre of,<note place="margin">Actes. 17.</note> becauſe he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uealeth him ſelfe inwardly in vs.</p>
               <p>After therefore the Euangeliſt had ſet before vs the general conſideration of the grace of Chriſt, that he might bring men to a more neare conſideration therof, he ſheweth what is ſpeciallye geuen vnto them: namelye, that they are not in crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion like vnto brute Beaſtes: but are ſet in a more hye degrée, hauing a minde in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with reaſon and capeable of wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, that they being indued with this wiſdome, might be brought to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God, the verye well of life: So ſayeth the Prophete <hi>Dauid,</hi>

               </p>
               <q>And the light shineth in darkeneſſe. A.</q>
               <p>Here the Euangeliſt beginneth to note men of ingratitude and blindneſſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe by theyr wickedneſſe they reiecte this light offered vnto them. And that we maye vnderſtand this thing, we muſt note that the Euangeliſt firſt of al admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſheth that the light, with the whiche men were indued in the beginning, muſt not be iudged, according to theyr preſent ſtate, becauſe in this corrupted and defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led nature, the light is turned into darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. Notwithſtanding, he therewith affirmeth that the light of vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding is not cleane put out: becauſe in the obſcure darkeneſſe of mans minde, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine ſparkes of light as yet do ſpring vp. <hi>M.</hi> The Euangeliſt therefore ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſeth the Diuinitye and Maieſtye of Chriſt, when he ſayth that the ſame hath euer ſhined vnto mortall men, as a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne moſt euident and manifeſt light: and he layeth all the blame of the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunce of GOD, on the blindneſſe of men. <hi>C.</hi> For in that he affirmeth the light to ſhine in darkeneſſe, that pertay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth nothing at all to the praiſe of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt nature, but rather to the taking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way of the pretenced cloake of ignorance. <hi>M.</hi> For this light ſhineth in the world, and the mindes of mortall men might by the ſame haue béene brought to the knowledge of the liuing of God, had not theyr mindes béene ouerwhelmed with darkeneſſe. For hée calleth here the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:14631:8"/>
blindneſſe of mennes mindes, vnbeléefe, impietye, and the ignoraunce of GOD, darkeneſſe. For as the eyes that are blinde, can not comprehende the light, euen ſo the mindes that are blinded, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not comprehend the light of life. <hi>A.</hi> And as the light is preſent to the blinde man, the whiche notwithſtanding is abſent from his eyes: euen ſo the light of life is preſent to mortall men, the whiche not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding theyr mindes being oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with darkeneſſe, can not attaine. <hi>C.</hi> For ſince the time that man was alienated and fallen from GOD, igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunce hath ſo captiued his minde, that what light ſo euer remaineth in the ſame, lieth ſuffocated and choked without effect. And this thing experience dayly proueth. For they which are not borne againe by the ſpirite of GOD, hauing ſome rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, ſtande for a certaine document, that man was not onelye made to breathe, but alſo to vnderſtande.</p>
               <p>But there are twoo ſpeciall partes of the light, which remayneth as yet in the corrupt nature of man. For there is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turallye ingrafted in all men a certaine ſound ſéede of religion or godlineſſe. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore, a difference of good and euill is ingrauen in theyr Conſciences.</p>
               <p>But what fruictes at the length come foorth? ſurely that religion, &amp; Godlyneſſe, which doeth degenerate into a thouſand monſterous ſuperſticions, and that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience which doeth altogeather peruert iudgement, that it may confounde vice with vertue. To conclude, the naturall reaſon which is in man, doth neuer direct men vnto Chriſt.</p>
               <p>But we muſt note that the Euangeliſt ſpeaketh only of natural giftes, &amp; that he doth not as yet touch the grace of regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. For there are two diſtinct vertues of the ſonne of God: the firſt is that which appeareth in the making of the worlde, and in the order of nature: the ſecond ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth in the renuing and repairing of the decayed and defiled nature of man.</p>
               <p n="6">
                  <hi>6. There was a man ſent from God, whoſe name was <hi>John.</hi>

               <q>There was a man ſent from GOD. C.</q>
               <p>Nowe the Euangeliſt beginneth to ſhewe how the worde of God was mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted in the fleſhe. For Chriſt did not onelye offer and ſet him ſelfe before the eyes of men to be ſéene, but he woulde alſo be knowne by the teſtimonie and doctrine of <hi>Iohn.</hi> Yea, GOD the father ſent him before to be a witneſſe to his ſonne Chriſt, to the ende all men might the more eaſilie receyue the ſaluation of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred of him. <hi>R.</hi> Euen as therefore the Lorde GOD, when he went about to make the worlde, he reuealed him ſelfe out of the profounde darckeneſſe, that is to ſay, out of nothing by the word: Euen ſo when he went about to reſtore the Faithfull, and to repayre his Church, he ſent his Sonne appearing outwardlye and in the ſight of men: euen as if he had béene God in no point, vntill at the length the glory of his Godhead more and more appeared: for he was couered with the fragillitye of the fleſhe, and the ſhame of the Croſſe, leaſt at the firſt ſight he ſhoulde be knowen.

               </p>
               <p>Therefore when Chriſt ſhoulde come in the fleſhe, and couered with the ſhame of the Croſſe, he did not amis to ſend before his face a witneſſe. For ſo alſo the Lord foreſhewed by <hi>Malachy</hi> that it ſhoulde come to paſſe, ſaying:<note place="margin">Mala. 3</note>

For this is not a ſufficient certaintie or warraunt, when men that runne of them ſelues, boaſt them ſelues to be ſent of GOD: but the Euangeliſt ſpeaking hereafter ſomewhat more of this witneſſe, thought it ſufficient in one word to ſhew that he came not but by the commaundement of God: after that we ſhall ſée how hée affirmeth God to be the Aucthor of his miniſterie.<note place="margin">Math. 1.

This our Euangeliſt, after he had ſayde that he was ſent of GOD, addeth this onely which was more neceſſarye, namelye to what purpoſe he came being ſent of God, namely, to beare witneſſe.</p>

For him, whome the Prophetes fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhewed ſhoulde come, <hi>Iohn</hi> the Baptiſt pointed out with the finger.</p>
               <q>That al men through him might beleeue.</q>

It was neceſſary therefore that ſuch a witneſſe ſhoulde be ſente, as the Iſraelites might geue cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite vnto. For this cauſe he was ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with the grace of GOD, that he made all men to beholde him.</p>

By this grace was ſet foorth to the worlde, not onelie the teſtimonye which <hi>Iohn</hi> bare concerning Chriſt, but alſo the teſtimony of all the Apoſtles and Euangeliſtes, both by voyce and writing.

               <p>The Apoſtles alſo are ſpecially called the light, becauſe they preferre the light of the Goſpell, which driueth awaye the darkeneſſe of the worlde.

               <p>
                  <hi>R.</hi> Wherefore this place, putteth a difference not only betweene Chriſt and <hi>Iohn,</hi> but alſo betwéene Chriſt and al the Saints, Patriarks, Prophets, Apoſtles, and Martyrs: For neither <hi>Iohn,</hi> nor any other of all the Saintes, were the true light, but were onelye proclaimers, and ſetters forth of the true light. <hi>M.</hi> Let vs therefore hereby learne to eſtéeme of the Saintes, as they are made and appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of GOD, and no otherwiſe.</p>
               <q>But was ſent to beare witneſſe of the light.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>A. <hi>Iohn</hi>
                  </hi> therefore repeateth this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine to ſhew what men ought to iudge of them, which being ſent of God, preach the word vnto the world: Leaſt we attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute any thing, of that vnto them which pertaineth onelye to the Sonne of God. <hi>M.</hi> For great is the wilfull folly of the world in this point. Eyther it reiecteth altogether the witneſſes of Chriſt, and deſpiſeth them, or elſe it geueth reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and honoureth them aboue Chriſt.</p>
               <p>The Iewes at the firſt receyued <hi>Iohn</hi> for the <hi>Meſsias</hi> Chriſt him ſelfe, which was not Chriſt: &amp; yet they receyued not the teſtimony which he bare vnto Chriſt. Euen ſo the <hi>Corinthians</hi> litle or nothing at all regarded <hi>Paul,</hi> that ſingular Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher of the kingdome of Chriſt, but they made more of the falſe Apoſtles, than appertayned to the Myniſters of of Chriſt,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 4</note> inſomuch that the Apoſtle was faine to ſhewe them what they ought to thinke of the Miniſters of Chriſt, and what not: And we our ſelues haue had experience, what great eſtimation the worlde hath had, and yet hath of dead Saintes, and of the Byſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> and others, and howe litle it regardeth the true Miniſters of Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="9">
                  <hi>9. He was the true light, lightening euerye man that commeth into the worlde.</hi>
               </p>
               <q>Hee was the true light.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>C.</hi> The true light is not here oppoſed or compared to the falſe light, but the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uangeliſt here goeth about to put a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betwéene our ſauiour Chriſt and al other, leaſt that any man ſhould thinke that he is euen the ſame light, &amp; no better than y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> which angels &amp; men are ſaid to be.</p>
               <p>But this is the difference, that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer is bright and ſhining in Heauen and in earth, it borroweth his bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe from another: But Chriſt is light of him ſelfe, and ſhining by him ſelfe, and lightening with his brightneſſe the whole worlde: inſomuche that there is no other cauſe or Originall of bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, but hee.

               <p>
                  <hi>M.</hi> Therefore this is the firſt note by the whiche Chriſt is diſcerned from <hi>Iohn,</hi> and from all other Apoſtles.</p>
               <p>For <hi>Iohn</hi> and the Apoſtles were light (as it is ſayde before) but not the true light,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:14631:10"/>
that is to ſaye, not that naturall light, which ſhineth of it ſelfe, and which taketh no force to ſhine of anye other. Suche a one is Chriſt, but <hi>Iohn</hi> and the Apoſtles not ſo: for if they had not béene illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated by this light, they had béene altogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther darckeneſſe.</p>
               <q>Lightning euerye one that commeth.</q>
               <p>Here he putteth the other note of true light, by the which he is diſcerned from the other Saintes, being lightned.</p>
               <p>Many are (trulye) lightened by <hi>Iohn</hi> and the Apoſtles of Chriſt, as it were by the inſtrumentes and Miniſters of the light: but all men are not ſimplye lighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by them. But this place was wont to be expounded two maner of wayes. For ſome reſtraine and referre vnto them an vniuerſal note, which are regenerated by the ſpirite of God, &amp; are made pertakers of the quickening light: and ſo the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of this place to be, that none is illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated but by him, euen as if there be in the Citye one Schoolemaiſter which hath a Schoole, he ſhall be called the Schoole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayſter of the whole Citye, although fewe come vnto the Schoole. But this o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſence and meaning ſéemeth to bée more nere and agréeing to the purpoſe of the Euangeliſt, namelye that certaine beames are diffunded and powred from this light into all mankinde: as it was alſo ſayde at the firſt. For we knowe that men haue this ſpeciallye aboue all other creatures, namelye that they are indued with reaſon and vnderſtanding, that they beare and haue in theyr conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence the difference betwéene that which is right and falſe. There is none there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, to whome ſome ſence and féeling of the eternall light commeth not.</p>
               <p>But bycauſe Fanaticall men raſhelye taking this place doe wreſt the ſame, that they might thereby gather that the grace of lightning is offred to all men alike: Let vs note that the Euangeliſt onelye here intreateth of the common light of of Nature, which neuer groweth vnto fayth. For no man can pearce or at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chéeue to the kindome of GOD, no not with all the induſtrie and prompt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of his minde: it is onely the ſpirite of Chriſt which openeth the gate of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to the elect.<label type="milestone">

But their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion is better to be liked, which refer it to the <hi>Iewes</hi> onelye: for there is in theſe wordes contayned a ſecret compariſon, by the whiche the Euangeliſt doth the more Exaggerate the ingratitude of men.</p>
               <p>The ſonne of GOD in one nation choſe him out a place to dwell in, and when he came thyther, hee was reiected.

                  <hi>C.</hi> The Papiſtes by this place gather that it is in our power eyther to chooſe, or to reiect this grace. But the text it ſelfe doth plainelye ouerthrowe this falſe col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection.

               <p>This making commeth not by the will of fleſh, but by the will of God, by the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of regeneration. Wherfore, if faith doe regenerate vs that we maye be the ſonnes of God, and if God from heauen doe enſpire the ſame into vs, it is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt that the grace of adoption is not only offered to vs of Chriſt in power, but alſo euen in the verye acte. Moreouer in this, Chriſt hath woonderfullye ſet foorth his grace, that he hath giuen this honour to vncleane and prophane men, yea to ſuche as lie in the ſhadowe of death, that they ſhould now ſodenlye begin to be the ſons of God.

               <p>He doth briefelye note the maner of receyuing of Chriſt, namelie when men beléeue in him.

And certainelye ſéeing hée is the onelye begotten ſonne of God, this honor pertayneth nothing at all vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs, were it not that we are his mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers. <hi>M.</hi> To beléeue in the name of Chriſt (as wée ſhewed euen now) is to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyue him as the ſonne of GOD, and the Sauiour of the whole worlde, the which is done of vs when we depende wholye vpon him by a ſincere fayth and truſt, and commit our ſelues wholye as Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples vnto him.

Therefore they which beléeue not, receyue not Chriſt, they cannot ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine this ſauing helth, and dignity of the ſonnes of God, in ſo much that they muſt of neceſſitie periſh with this world vnder the wrath.</p>

The Euangeliſt rather repeating one thing by diuerſe woordes, goeth about to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culcate the ſame, and to print it more déepelye in our mindes. Therefore hée doth ſecréetelye touche the wicked truſt and confidence of the Iewes, who had alwayes in theyr monthes the worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of theyr ofſpring, as though they ſpringing from a holye Progeny, were Saintes by nature.

               <p>Therefore in diuers reſpectes, faith is a part of our regeneration, and an ente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunce into the kingdome of Heauen, that wée might bée nombred among the children of God.

But they which are adopted to bee the Sonnes of God, are not borne of the ſubſtaunce of God, (as was Chriſt the onely begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten ſonne of GOD) but they being by grace taken for heyres and ſonnes, are alſo chaunged in minde, and of carnall are made ſpirituall.

               </p>
               <p>Wee gather alſo by this place, that faith commeth not of our ſelues, but is the fruite of ſpirituall regeneration For the Eua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>geliſt affirmeth that no man can beléeue, but hée which is borne of God.

The ſcripture ſpeaking of a man, contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuouſlye, calleth him fleſhe. When as therefore the Euangeliſt, calleth the ſonne of God fleſhe, he meaneth, that he hath ſo much abaſed him ſelfe, that he hath taken vppon him this fleſhe, ſubiect to ſo many miſeries. <hi>R.</hi> As to fragillity, contempt, execration, pouertye, hunger, thirſt, nakedneſſe, death, and damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: and that wee might bee made through him, Strong, Bleſſed, Ritch, Full, Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal, and righteous, whereby we haue euerlaſting ſaluation.</p>

               <p>For this is a figuratiue kinde of ſpeache, becauſe the inferiour part doth compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hende the whole man.

               <p>And the ſcripture, when it calleth men fleſhe, it doeth not thereby make them voyde of Soule. It is verye manifeſt therefore that the woorde being begotten before all worldes of the Father, and whiche was alwayes with the Father, was made man.<note place="margin">Iohn. 2</note>

               <p>Herevppon it is that <hi>Paul</hi> calleth the Lawe the adminiſtration of death and condemnacion, and a kylling Letter.<note place="margin">Deut. 27 Gala. 3 2. Cor. 3</note>

                  <hi>A.</hi> But when we come vnto Chriſt, we finde in him grace, <hi>C.</hi> that is to ſaye, the Spirituall fulfilling of thoſe thinges which the lawe contayned in the letter: we finde alſo in him trueth, that is to ſaye, a firme, and ſounde ſtabillitye of thinges.</p>
               <p>The Euangeliſt therefore teacheth howe muche inferyoure the Myniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye of <hi>Moyſes</hi> was to the power of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>M.</hi> Moreouer theſe twoo, grace, and trueth, are oftentimes in the Scripture ioyned togeather: <hi>C.</hi> but here by a fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure called <hi>Hypallage,</hi> they are bothe aptlye referred to one ende: as if he had ſayde: That grace by which the trueth of the lawe ſtandeth, was at the length offered in Chriſt. But becauſe the ſence wyll remaine all one, it maketh no matter whether they bée ioyned or ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated. This truely is certayne that the Euangeliſt woulde haue this graun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that the Image of all Spirituall bleſſinges was ſhaddowed onelye in the Lawe: but in Chriſte perfectlye pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed and reuealed. Wherevppon it followeth, that if we ſeparate the Law from Chriſt, there ſhal nothing remaine

               <p>In conſideration of the which, S. <hi>Paule</hi> ſayth,<note place="margin">Colloſſ. 2</note> 
                  <hi>that in the lawe are shadowes, but in Chriſt the body. <hi>M.</hi>
                  </hi> And <hi>Moy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> is ſayde to be farre inferiour vnto Chriſt, becauſe he was in the houſe of GOD as a ſeruaunt, for a teſtimonye of thoſe thinges whiche ſhoulde be ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken:<note place="margin">Heb. 3</note> but Chriſt was as Lorde ouer his houſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>C.</hi> The truth therefore conſiſteth in this, that by Chriſt wée obtaine grace, which the Lawe coulde not beſtow. So that this worde, grace, is taken as well for the frée remiſſion of our ſinnes, as for the renouation of the heart.</p>

                  <hi>C.</hi> This is very well and aptly added for the confirmation of the former ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence.

               <p>Wherfore our condition is farre better than the ſtate of the fathers: becauſe GOD which at the firſt lay hid in his ſecret glory, hath now after a ſort made himſelfe viſible.</p>
               <p>For certainely, when Chriſt is called the very expreſſe image of the father, that pertayneth to a ſpeciall benefite of the newe Teſtament.

                  </hi> Now <hi>Iohn</hi> the Baptiſt doth ſecret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye reprehende the blindeneſſe of the Iewes, becauſe they were ignoraunt of Chriſt, to whom principally they ſhould haue directed their mindes. And he doth alwayes inculcate this diligentlye, that no part of his miniſterie can be knowne vntill they be come to the aucthor him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. Hée ſayth that Chriſt ſtandeth in the middeſt of them, to the ende that hée might ſtirre vp their indeuour to know him. <hi>M.</hi> And hée noteth therewith alſo their peruerſe and worldely iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, by the which they iudged of the men of God according to the outwarde appearaunce, and vaine ſhewe. Chriſt was in the middeſt of them, that is to ſaye, hée was conuerſaunt among them: but they knewe him not. And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore? Bycauſe he was baſe in his out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde appearaunce, and as a common man. By the waye let vs here note that it is the lot of Gods children, not to bée knowne in the worlde, and becauſe they are not knowne, they are ſure to haue reproche for their parte.

               <p>
                  <hi>C.</hi> There is no doubt, but that before this time hée had ſpoken of the reuealing of the <hi>Meſsias,</hi> but when Chriſt was come foorth, hée thought it good in ſhort time to publiſh his proclamation con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Chriſt: and now the time was at hande in the which Chriſt ended the office of <hi>Iohn,</hi> euen as when the ſonne is ryſen, the twy light (as wée call it) vaniſheth awaye.

And this is the cauſe why Chriſt offereth himſelfe into the preſence of <hi>Iohn.</hi> Therefore the next daye following <hi>Iohn</hi> ſawe Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus comming to him. <hi>M.</hi> But from whence, and to what ende?

               <p>
                  <hi>C.</hi> He nowe briefelye and plainely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poundeth the office of Chriſt, namelye, that he taking awaye the ſinnes of the worlde by his death, reconcileth men vnto God. Chriſt truelye beſtoweth other benefites vpon vs, but this is the chiefe vppon whiche the reſt depende, that hée in pacifying the wrathe of his Father, maketh vs to bée counted iuſt and righteous.</p>
               <p>For out of this well floweth all Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers of good thinges, becauſe God not imputing our ſinnes, receyueth vs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his fauour. But by this word <hi>(Lambe)</hi> he hath reſpect to the olde Sacrifices of the Lawe. Hée had to do with the <hi>Iewes,</hi> who being accuſtomed with Sacrifices, coulde bée no otherwiſe taught concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning remiſſion of ſinnes, than by ſetting before them a ſacrifice. And there being many kindes of Sacrifices, he maketh mencion onely of one, by a figure called <hi>Sinecdoche.</hi> And it is likely that <hi>Iohn</hi> had reſpect vnto the Paſchall Lambe.</p>
               <p>So that the <hi>Iewes</hi> for the moſt part, hauing a verye groſſe and ſuperſticious opinion of Sacrifices, were of him re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooued for the ſame, ſhewing to what ende all thoſe belong. This was the wicked abuſe of Sacrifycing, that they had theyr truſt repoſed and fired in the outward ſignes. Therfore <hi>Iohn</hi> ſetting Chriſt before them, affirmeth him to bée the Lambe of God: by the which he mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth that whatſoeuer ſacrifices the <hi>Iewes</hi> were wont to offer vnder the Lawe, they were of no force to put awaye ſinnes: but were only figures, the truth of which were fulfilled in Chriſt him ſelfe:<note place="margin">Heb. 9.10.

               <p>Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> vſeth this worde ſinne in the ſingular number, for all kinde of iniquitye: as if hée ſhoulde ſaye, what vnrighteouſneſſe ſoeuer there bée, which allienateth God from men, it is taken away by Chriſt. <hi>B.</hi> For chriſt is he alone which taketh away the ſins of the world: for hée which beléeueth this teſtimonye, wil craue al pardon for his offence of this our onely hye Prieſt, all other creatures ſet apart (Good men maye exhorte to beléeue in Chriſt, and to hope for remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſinnes at his hande, and maye alſo teſtifye that all ſinnes are truely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the faithfull: but they can not remitte or pourge ſinnes by theyr owne power, or geue and encreaſe Faith in Chriſt. For he is the onelye meane to take awaye ſinnes. We muſt alſo note by theſe woordes of <hi>Iohn</hi> the Baptiſt, that Chriſt was manifeſted to bée a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, not onely to the <hi>Iewes,</hi> but alſo to bée made a Mediatour and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour, to the whole worlde.</p>
               <p>As our Euangeliſt ſayeth alſo in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place:<note place="margin">1. Epiſt. 2</note> 
                  <hi>He dyed not for our ſinnes onelye, but for the ſinnes of the whole worlde.</hi> The which is not ſo to bée vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtoode, as though that ſlaine Lambe tooke away the ſins of them onely which in this worlde lyue in the newe Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment whereſoeuer: No, it is not ſo to bée vnderſtoode, for he taketh away the ſinnes of all thoſe alſo, which from the beginning of the worlde were partakers of the grace of GOD.

               <p>So we reade that this Lambe was ſlaine from the beginning of the worlde.<note place="margin">Reuela. 13</note> 
                  <hi>C.</hi> Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> therefore goeth about to ſhewe that there remayneth nothing nowe for ſinners, but that they flée vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Chriſt theyr refuge: to the ende he might ouerthrowe all ſatiſfactions, offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringes, and redemptions of men, being nothing but falſe and forged colluſions of Satan our enemye.</p>

               <p>Let vs knowe therefore, that wée now at the laſt for Chriſt his ſake are recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled vnto God the Father, if wée take the right waye vnto his death, and if we doo beléeue that hée was the onelye Sacrifice nayled to the Croſſe, which ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth away our ſinnes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>R.</hi> Furthermore, Chriſt doth not ſo take awaye ſinnes, that it maye bée law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for euerye man licentiouſlye to liue as him lyſteth (as the carnall falſely ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) but that we ſhould liue vnto God,<note place="margin">Rom. 6</note> and to righteouſneſſe.

a raſhe zeale, did greatlye withſtande the opinion and Iudgement of theyr Maiſter. Secondlye in this, that it is ſhewed wherevpon they were moued to followe Chriſt.

                  </hi> He was not ignoraunt what they ſought for. But thus he meant by his gentleneſſe to make them more bolde, and take from them al ſhamefaſtneſſe. For he doth very wel firſt of all to demaunde what they ſeeke: becauſe it maketh verye much what they ſeeke for which followe Chriſt.</p>
               <p>One ſayde vnto Chriſt, Maiſter I wil followe thée whether ſoeuer thou goeſt.</p>
               <p>But becauſe he ſought not for that thing in Chriſt which he ſhoulde haue ſought for: he was not admitted to bée a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, but hearde it ſayde vnto him: <hi>The Foxes haue holes,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Math. 8</note> 
                  <hi>and the Birdes of the ayre haue neſtes, but the Sonne of man hath not where to reſt his head. <hi>C.</hi>
                  </hi> But this ſo gentle and friendly inuitacion, which pertayned to theſe twoo, doth now pertaine vnto all men. Wherefore we néede not feare that Chriſt will hyde him ſelfe from vs, or will denye vs acceſſe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him: If he perceyue that we deſyre to come vnto him: but will rather ſtretch foorth his hande to helpe our indeuours.</p>
               <p>And howe ſhould not he helpe thoſe that come vnto him, which ſéeketh a farre of thoſe that go aſtray, that he might bring them into the waye?</p>
               <q>They ſayde vnto him, <hi>Rabby,</hi> M.</q>
               <p>They woulde not ſlightlye, and with circumſtaunces by the waye, ſhewe vnto him what they ſought for, but (as it was néedefull in a matter of waight) meant to declare vnto him theyr minde a parte, and that more exactly, and to vnderſtand of him the worde of trueth: therefore they aſke of him where he dewelleth, or (as it is in the Gréeke texte) where hée abideth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>C.</hi> The name of <hi>Rabbi</hi> was common to greate men, and ſuch as were of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour

and great calling. But here the Euangeliſt ſheweth another vſe of this worde in his time, namelye, that Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours and interpretours of the woorde of GOD were ſaluted with this name. Althoughe therefore as yet they knowe not Chriſt to bee the onelye Maiſter of his Churche, yet notwithſtanding they being mooued with the title that <hi>Iohn</hi> gaue vnto him, they doe count him as a Prophete and teacher, the whiche is the firſt ſteppe to aptneſſe to be taught.</p>
               <q>Where dwelleſt thou?</q>
               <p>By this example we are taught not to be content with the naked &amp; bare ſight of Chriſt, but alſo to ſéeke, where his abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding place is, that he maye receyue vs as Gheſtes. For there are ſome which ſmel the Goſpell a farre of, and ſo they ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer Chriſt ſodainelye to vaniſhe awaye, and to let ſlippe whatſoeuer they had learned of him. And although they were not then made his Diſciples, yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, there is no doubt but that the ſame night he did more fully inſtruct them, inſomuch that a litle after they were wholly addicted vnto him.</p>
               <p n="39">
                  <hi>39. He ſayth vnto them: Come and ſee. They came and ſawe where he dwelt, and abode with him that day: for it was about the tenth houre.</hi>

               <q>Come and ſee. M.</q>
               <p>Who can ſufficientlye expreſſe this great facillitye and humanity of our ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour Chriſt? He might honeſtly haue made a deniall of that whiche they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded, or in twoo words haue ſhewed them the place of his abiding: but he is ſo farre from being offended with theyr vntimelye comming, that he inuiteth and biddeth them to come, and ſée his Manſion place, when they demaunded where the ſame was.<note place="margin">Iohn. 6</note>

               </p>
               <p>Great therefore is the facillitye and gentleneſſe of Chriſt toward theſe Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples.

But in that he ſayth, <hi>Come and ſee,</hi> and ſayeth not rather, I dwell here, or I dwell there: It ſeemeth to declare, that no man can knowe Chriſt a right, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept he haue experience of the féeling of Chriſt by faith. <hi>They shall be all taught</hi> (ſayth the Prophete) <hi>of God.</hi> But that feeling of faith commeth not but by the miniſterye of the woorde.<note place="margin">Eſay. 54</note>

               <p>In that Chriſt prayſeth <hi>Nathanael,</hi> hée doth it not for his ſake, but vnder his perſon he propoundeth a common doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine.

                  <hi>A.</hi> Touching the opening of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens, it is already ſpoken of in the third Chapter of Saint <hi>Mathew.</hi> In that Chriſt ſpeaketh of the opening of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens, and of the aſcending and deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the Angels vppon the Sonne of man: many referre it to the reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Chriſt, to his aſcention, and to the ſending of the holye Ghoſt. <hi>C.</hi> But it rather ſignifieth a certaine continuance, whiche ſhoulde alwayes bée extant in his kingdome. It is moſt certayne that Angelles appeared ſometimes vnto the Diſciples whiche at this daye are not ſéene: it is certaine alſo that there was another maner of reuelation of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenlye glory, when Chriſt aſcended into Heauen, than we nowe ſée.</p>
               <p>But if we well waye and conſyder of the matter, wee ſhall finde that the ſame which was done then, is abiding for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer.</p>
               <p>For the kingdome of Heauen being ſhut vp againſt vs at the firſt,<note place="margin">Actes. 7 Math. 17 Luke. 24.</note> was tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye opened againe in Chriſt. Of this matter as well <hi>Stephen,</hi> and thrée other Diſciples in the Mounte, had a viſible ſight, as alſo other of the Apoſtles in the aſcention of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>But all the ſignes by the whiche the Lorde ſheweth him ſelfe to bée preſent with vs, do pertaine to the opening of Heauen, ſpecially where he doth commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate him ſelfe vnto vs to life.</p>
               <p>The Angelles are ſayd to aſcende and deſcende, as they are Miniſters vnto vs of Gods wyl. Therefore by theſe words the mutuall communication betwéene God and men is noted. And we muſt be thankefull vnto Chriſt for this benefite: becauſe without him ther is rather mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal enmity betwéene the Angels and vs, than a familiar care to helpe. Therefore they are ſayde to aſcende and deſcende vppon him, not that they doe onely mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter vnto him, but becauſe in reſpect of him, and for his honour, they holde vp by theyr care the whole bodye of the Church.<note place="margin">Gene. 28</note> And there is no doubte but that hée hath ſome reſpect vnto the Ladder whiche was ſhewed to the Patriarke <hi>Iacob</hi> by a viſion.

               <p>To be ſhorte, the ſumme of this place is, that where as all mankinde was ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed from the kingdome of God, now the gate of the kingdome of Heauen is opened vnto vs, that we maye bée Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens

For ſhe commaundeth them to haue reſpecte onelye to the commaundement of her ſonne, being neither offended with the ſharpe aunſwere that hée gaue her, nor yet diſtruſting his goodneſſe and power, but hoping that at length he wyll ſupply the want. <hi>C.</hi> She ſheweth alſo an exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of true obedience, which ſhe ought vnto her ſonne, when the matter ſtoode not vpon humane duety, but vpon his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine power. She ſtayeth her ſelfe ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore modeſtlye vppon the aunſwere of Chriſte, and exhorteth other likewiſe to obey his commaundement. And the power which ſhe might haue ſéemed to challenge to her ſelfe as a mother, ſhe vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly reiecteth, wyllyng all obedience to be geuen vnto Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Therefore we are hereby generallye taught, that if wée deſire anye thing of Chriſt, we can not obtaine our peticions by anye other meanes than to depende wholly vpon him, to haue reſpect vnto him, and to do that which he commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth. <hi>Bv.</hi> Wherfore this place is quite contrary to the ſuperſticious, worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping for the Creator the creature, thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the Lorde Ieſus to be ſo tyed to his mother by duety, that he can deny her no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. Whervpon they leauing the true mediatour and interceſſour the ſonne of God, turne them ſelues to his mother the virgin, aſking that of her, which they ſhoulde aſke of the ſonne. <hi>A.</hi> But ſhe ſendeth other vnto Chriſte, whom they ſhoulde heare by right, according to the commaundement of God, <hi>Heare him.</hi>

               <p>Chriſt by and by goeth about to purge the Temple, plainely affirming that the Temple of the Lorde is not a place of Marchandize. Notwithſtanding, it may bée demaunded why hée began not firſt with doctrine: for this ſéemeth to bée a troubleſome and prepoſterous waye, to correcte vice with violence,

before the ſame were aſſayed to bée re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medyed by Doctrine. But Chriſt had reſpecte to another matter. For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the time was nowe at hande, in the which hée ſhoulde openly diſcharge the office inioyned to him of the father, he woulde after a ſorte take poſſeſſion of the Temple, and plainelye declare his Diuine aucthoritye.</p>
               <p>And to the ende all men might bée at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiue vnto his Doctrine, it was méete that theyr ſluggiſhe mindes ſhoulde bée wakened with a newe and vnwonted déede. The Temple was now a place of heauenlye Doctrine. When he went about to reſtore the puritye of Doctrine, it was méete that he ſhoulde ſhewe him ſelfe to bée Lorde of the Temple.

Therefore this thing which hée did was a certaine begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of that reformacion for the which hée was ſent of the Father.</p>

               <p>But we ſée the contrarye to bée done here of Chriſte. He caſt the Byars and Sellers out of the Temple, although they kept couetouſnes in theyr breſtes.</p>

               <p>So at another time, he ſuffered not a veſſell to bée caryed through the Temple.

But they defende not theyr déede, as though they were without iuſt cauſe caſte out of the Temple. For they could not denye but that they had made of the houſe of God, a houſe of marchandiſe. What then doe they demaunde? Surely, they demaund by what aucthority, with ſuche ſeueritye, he caſteth out the Byers and ſellers. For by ſéeking to blame Chriſt, they goe about to excuſe theyr owne faulte. For hée had ſayd, <hi>Make not the houſe of my Father, a houſe of Marchandiſe.</hi>

               <p>Wherfore, except they had béene ſtarke blinde, this miracle was euident enough to be ſéene, that one ſhoulde bée ſo bolde to ſtand againſt ſo many, that one which was a naked man, ſhoulde not let to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter with the valiaunt, that one baſe in the ſight of men, ſhould contend with Princes.

For ſéeing at that time learned men were commonlye called Mayſters, <hi>Nicodemus</hi> ſaluteth Chriſt by this name according to the accuſtomed manner: and afterward affyrmeth him to be ſent of God to teache.

               <p>The like alſo we maye beholde at this day in the Papiſtes.

               <p>It is no maruaile therefore if <hi>Nico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demus</hi> do ſtumble here as it were at a ſtrawe.

Titus. 3.5. 1. Pet. 3.12.</note> as may appeare in diuers places of Scripture, but ſpeciallye by theſe places noted in the margent.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>C.</hi> And as touching this place we ought to vnderſtand the ſame ſimplye of mans regeneration, and not of Baptiſme. For the purpoſe of Chriſt was to exhort <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>codemus</hi> to newneſſe of life, becauſe hée was not capable of the Goſpell, vntil he were a newe man. Therefore this is the ſimple meaning of this ſentence. That it behooueth vs to bée borne againe, that wée maye be the Sonnes of GOD, and alſo that the holye Ghoſt is the auc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour of this ſeconde byrth. For <hi>Nico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demus</hi> dreaming of a <hi>Pithagoricall</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation: Chriſt to waken and remoue him from that errour, added this for an interpretacion of that which he ſpake be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, namelye, that man was not natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally borne againe,<note place="margin">The holy ghoſt the aucthour of our rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration.</note> neyther was it néede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full that a man ſhoulde haue a newe body: but that he is borne againe, when hée is renewed by the grace of the holye Ghoſt, both in ſoule and minde. And therefore by theſe wordes (Spirite, and water) hée vnderſtandeth all one thing.</p>
               <p>The which interpretacion ought not to ſéeme in any mans ſence to ſtrayte and farre fetcht. For it is a common phraſe of ſpeache in the Scripture, when men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion is made of the Spirite, to adde the name of Water and Fyre, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe the force of the ſame.</p>
               <p>In thirde of Mathew it is ſayde, that <hi>Chriſt baptized with the holy Ghoſt,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Math. 3.11</note> 
                  <hi>and with fire:</hi> in the which place, there is no difference in ſence betwéene fyre and the holye Ghoſt, but doth onelye ſignifie what the efficacye of Gods ſpirite is in vs. And where as here wee haue the name of water ſet before the ſpirite, it maketh no great matter: nay, rather this maner of ſpeache ſoundeth better than that other of <hi>Mathew:</hi> becauſe the plaine ſence and meaning followeth the <hi>Metaphore:</hi> as if Chriſt ſhould haue ſayde, No man is the ſonne of God vntil ſuch time as hée is renewed and borne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine by water: that is to ſaye, by the ſpirite, which purgeth vs anewe, and which by his grace and power in vs, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpireth and repleniſheth vs with the moyſture of a heauenly life, ſéeing by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture wée are altogither drye, and withe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: And vppon good conſideration our Sauiour Chriſt bringeth this phraſe of ſpeache vſed in the Scriptures, to ſet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Nicodemus</hi> his ignoraunce and blindeneſſe. For <hi>Nicodemus</hi> ſhoulde haue knowne at the laſt, that the ſame which was ſpoken by our ſauiour Chriſt was taken out of the common doctrine of the Prophets. Therefore by water is ment, nothing elſe, but the inwarde purgation and moyſture of the holye Ghoſt. So that the ſecond is but an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plycation of the firſt. Wherevpon alſo our Sauiour, when hée addeth a reaſon why wée ought to be borne againe, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king no mencion of water, teacheth that the newneſſe of life which hée requireth, is wrought by the holy ghoſt. Wherfore it foloweth that water muſt not be ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from the ſpirite.</p>

                  <hi>B.</hi> This is a reaſon of that whiche went before. For therefore no man vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borne againe can enter into the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God, becauſe all that is borne of fleſhe, is nothing elſe by that firſt and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall Natiuitye, but fleſhe.

and blood can not enter into the kingdom of Heauen. For by the knowledge of GOD, wée are made partakers of his kingdome:<note place="margin">Iohn. 17.3. 1. Cor. 2.14.</note> for it is ſayde: <hi>This is life eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall (O Father) to knowe thee. &amp;c.</hi> Now man, which is fleſhe, can not vnderſtand thoſe thinges which belong vnto GOD. Therefore it is neceſſarye that ſo many as ſhall enter into the kingdome of God, bée tranſformed and ſpirituall: that is to ſaye, ſo many as wyll bée the Sonnes of God. <hi>C.</hi> Therefore Chriſt proueth by an argument of the contraryes, that wée are all ſhut out of the kingdome of God, except we haue entrance by regeneratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</p>
               <p>For hée taketh this as graunted vnto him, namelye, that wée cannot enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the kingdome of God, except we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſpirituall. But wée bring nothing from our mothers wombe, but our car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall nature. Therefore it followeth that wée are naturallye baniſhed out of the kingdome of God, and being depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of the celeſtiall life, doe abide vnder the bondage of death. This word fleſhe, doth ſignifye the whole man. For fleſhe in this place, doth not onelye ſignify the bodye, but alſo the Soule, and euery part of man. For the Papiſtes do very fond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye reſtraine it to that parte, which they call ſenſuall: becauſe by this meanes the argument of Chriſt ſhoulde bée verye vaine, as to ſaye, that the ſecond byrth is néedefull, becauſe ſome parte of vs is corrupted, and defiled.</p>
               <p>But if any man obiect and ſaye, that there remaineth yet ſome parte of Gods giftes in this our degenerate and corrupt nature: and therevppon conclude, that we are not in euery part paruerted and polluted: Wée maye eaſilye aunſwere to this obiection and ſaye: That thoſe giftes whiche GOD lefte in vs after the fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> in reſpect of them ſelues are highlye to bée eſtéemed and prayſed: but ſéeing the contagion and corruption of ſinne hath difunded and ſpread it ſelfe throughout euery part, we ſhall finde nothing in vs pure, and frée from all polluſion.</p>
               <p>Wherfore, as we haue naturally ſome knowledge of God, whereas there is ingraffed in vs a certaine diſcretion to iudge betwéene good and euill, Whereas wée haue wit and reaſon to defende this preſent life, and whereas wée excell the brute Beaſts, in ſo many notable giftes,<note place="margin">Mans na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.</note> theſe thinges of them ſelues, and as they proceede from God, are verye notable: but all thinges are defiled in vs no leſſe, than the Wine that is vnſauery through ſtinking Veſſelles, being made thereby verye hurtful. Therefore becauſe man, is by nature from his Mothers Byrth, onelye carnall, hée muſt bée tranſfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med againe by the Spirite, that he maye beginne to be ſpirituall.</p>
               <p>And this worde ſpirite, is here taken twoo manner of wayes, namelye, for grace, and for the effect of grace. For in the firſt place Chriſt teacheth, that the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye ghoſt is the onelye aucthour of a pure and reformed nature: In the ſecond place hée teacheth that we are ſpiritual, ſo ſone as wée are renued by the vertue of the ſame.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>R.</hi> Of this manner of renuing the Apoſtle alſo ſpeaketh, ſaying, <hi>The Lawe of the ſpirite of life, ſetteth me free from the power of ſinne and death, through Ieſus Chriſt. For what the Lawe coulde not doe, by that part, by which it was weake through the flesh: that did God by ſending his owne ſonne, in the ſimilltude of ſinfull fleshe: Euen by ſinne condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ſinne in the fleshe,</hi>

For they that are car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, are carnally minded, But they that are ſpirituall, are ſpirituall ye minded. To be carnallye minded: is death, but to bee ſpirituallye minded, is life and peace. Becauſe that the fleshlye minde is enmity againſt God: for it is not obedient to the lawe of God, neyther can bee. So then they that are in the fleshe can not pleaſe God. But ye are not in the fleshe, but in the ſpirite: If ſo be that the ſpirite of God dwell in you. <hi>M.</hi>
                  </hi> In this place the Apoſtle attributeth firſt to the fleſhe, and then to the ſpirite, certaine thinges which make very wel for the declaration of the woords of Chriſt. He geueth to the fleſhe twoo impoſſible thinges: The firſt is, that it cannot obeye the Law of God:
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:14631:37"/>
The ſeconde, that it can not pleaſe God. Herevppon it followeth that the ſame is vnder the power of ſinne and death, as an enemie vnto God, and that the Doctrine of the Letter, whiche hée here calleth the Lawe, cannot reforme the ſame: in ſo muche that it ſtandeth altogeather in neede of the Heauenlye power, by whiche wee are regenerate. Then he geueth that to the ſpirite which fulfilleth the iuſtification of the Lawe that is to ſaye, which maketh man ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall. For the Law requireth a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite conformable,<note place="margin">The ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite of God is the auc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of our regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> and agréeing with the will of God: Such a will doth the holy ghoſt begette. The ſpirite therfore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuereth from the power of Sinne and death, and quickeneth: and therefore it is called the ſpirite of life. <hi>C.</hi> But it is verye abſurde, which ſome haue gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vppon this place of Chriſt, namelye, that wée take our beginning of our firſt Parentes, not onelye in body, but alſo in ſoule.

So that we may out of this place note twoo ſpeciall Leſſons: The firſt is, that we ought not in any poynt to diſlike of the Goſpell, although it hath fewe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples on earth: As if Chriſt ſhould haue ſayde: Howe ſo euer ye refuſe my Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, it abydeth neuertheleſſe firme and ſtable: becauſe the hardneſſe of heart, and incredulitye that is in men, ſhall neuer bring to paſſe, but that God ſhall for euer abide iuſt and true.<note place="margin">Rom. 3.3</note> The ſecond is, that they ſhal not eſcape vnpuniſhed, which at this daye ſéeke to diſcredite the Goſpell, ſéeing it is the ſacred and moſt excellent trueth of God. With this Buckler, it behoueth vs to bée garded,<note place="margin">Fayth founded vpon God.</note> that wée maye goe forwarde in the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of the Goſpell, againſt the obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacie of men. And we muſt holde this as a moſt certaine trueth, that our faith is founded vpon God: but ſo ſoone as we haue God our aucthour, we ought bould<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye as men caryed aboue the Heauens, rather to deſpiſe the whole world, than that the infidelity of ſome ſhould trouble vs. <hi>M.</hi> Alſo it is a plaine argument of miſerable blindneſſe, that the teſtimony of thoſe men, which teſtifye nothing but

thoſe things which they know for a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine trueth ſhould bée reiected,<note place="margin">Lyes pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore trueth.</note> when as there is no lye ſo impudent, and notable, which in this world is not receiued.

                  </hi> Or (as it pleaſeth other ſome) this may ſimplye, be referred to the forms &amp; maners of tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching. For albeit the whole Sermon of our ſauiour chriſt were heauenly, yet for all that he ſpake ſo familiarlye, that the ſermon, after a ſort may ſéeme earthly. Furthermore, theſe words ought not to be reſtrained to the Sermon alone.

For where as ſome vnderſtande theſe woordes to be ſpoken of the exalting and lifting vp of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour Chriſt vpon the Croſſe, it agréeeth not with the text, and is very farre from the purpoſe of Chriſt.

And this order is diligently to be noted. For when the originall of our ſaluation com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth in queſtion, by and by, according to our naturall ambition, burſt foorth diueliſh imaginations of our owne me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites.

And our Sauiour doth ſlightlye paſſe ouer this loue, but doth dilligentlye amplyfie and inculcate the ſame, when hée maketh mention of the ſending of the onelye begotten ſonne of god: who was giuen vnto vs, as a moſt certaine and vndoubted pledge of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly loue towarde vs. <hi>R.</hi> Whereof then commeth ſaluation, whereof com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth iuſtification? whereof commeth the hope of eternall lyfe?

euer doubted of the truth of God? What néede is there then of the Teſtimony of Chriſt, whereby wée maye knowe God to bée true? But <hi>Iohn</hi> the Baptiſt ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth not here ſimplye of the trueth of God, but of that trueth, by which the promiſes made vnto Iſrael, (and in Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael to mankinde) were fulfilled and performed in Chriſt.<note place="margin">Rom. 15.8.</note> So Chriſt, is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Miniſter of Circumciſion, for the trueth of God, to confirme the promiſes made vnto the Fathers.</p>
               <p>This trueth of God can not bée appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended, without wée apprehende alſo the teſtimony of Chriſt.

For as he eſtée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth nothing more than his truth, euen ſo we can doe to him no ſeruice or wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippe more acceptable, than by our faith to profeſſe him to bée true: for then we ſhall geue vnto him his due honour.

               <p>Not that theyr impietye, can make the Faith and trueth of God of none effect, but becauſe they reprooue him of vanity.

                  <hi>M.</hi> Chriſt therefore declareth to the woman, what ſhee ought to haue done, rather than to haue denyed the Water which hée aſked. For thus ſhée ſhoulde haue ſayde, I haue néede to aſke of thée that water of lyfe, whereby I maye mitigate the Thryſt of my languiſhing and pyning Soule: and doeſt thou aſke this earthlye water of mée? Or thus: Howe commeth it to paſſe that thou, which art the well of lyfe, aſkeſt drinke of mée, which am a myſerable woman, and more drye than any Sponge? But rather geue thou vnto mée, out of thy Well, the water of lyfe.

               <p>Therefore the Lorde calleth not the dronken, to Drincke more, but the Thyrſtye: not the full bellyed to eate more, but the Hungrye. And to what ende ſhould Chriſt haue béene ſent with the fulneſſe of the Spirite, vnleſſe wée had béene emptye? Chriſt herewithall teacheth vs alſo, howe effectuall the knowledge of his graces, is, namely, of ſuche force, that it wyll incourage, and allure our myndes to deſyre the ſame. If thou kneweſt (ſayeth our Sauiour Chriſte) thou wouldeſt haue aſked. Therefore hée went about to make the Woman more deſyrous, leaſt ſhée ſhoulde contemptuouſlye reiect the lyfe offered vnto her.</p>
               <q>And he would haue geuen thee, of the Water of lyfe.</q>
               <p>This is a playne argument of Gods great goodneſſe, and lyberallitye, by which he doeth not onely conſider howe miſerable wée are, and of what bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fites we ſtande in néede, but alſo allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth vs to craue thoſe thinges which are prepared, and readye to bée offered vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs, ſo that we aſke them.

For his meaning is not, that we ſhall drinke our fyll the firſt daye, that hée geueth vnto vs his holye Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite: but that hée onelye ſéeketh to geue vs to vnderſtande, that the holy Ghoſt is a Spring flowing perpetuallye: and ſo,<note place="margin">He which once recey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth the ſpirite of God by faith, is ſealed to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal life.</note> that there is daunger leſt they ſhould wyther awaye, whiche are renewed by Spirituall grace.

pratler, and talker, how ſoeuer ſhée was elected to eternall life, and had the ſéede of God. For there is no doubt but that ſhee knewe well inoughe, that Chriſt ſpake of Spirituall water: but becauſe ſhee contemneth him, ſhée maketh no ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of all his promiſes.

               <p>And this againe, is a notable example of his mercy: for that almoſt he draweth her againſt her will, which wyllinglye would not come. Neuertheleſſe, we muſt here note, that they muſt be wounded with the féeling of ſinne, which are to ſecure, and almoſt paſt féeling. For to ſuch the Doctrine of Chriſt wyll ſéeme as a Tale, vntyll they being Sited to the Tribunall, and Iudgement ſeate of God, are conſtrayned to feare him as theyr Iudge, whome before they deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. After the ſame manner alſo all thoſe muſt bée handeled, which in ſcof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fing malepartneſſe, are not afrayde to rebell againſt the Doctrine of Chriſt, to the ende they maye know that this their wickedneſſe ſhall not eſcape vnpuniſhed. For ſo great is the oſtinacye of a greate many, that they wyll neuer vouchſafe to heare him, except they bée conſtrained therevnto. Therefore ſo often as we ſée the Oyle of Chriſt to bée vnſauerye, we muſt mingle the ſame with Vineger, that it maye beginne to ſauour. Yea, this is neceſſarye for euerye one of vs: for we are not ſeriouſlye affected, when Chriſt ſpeaketh, except we bée awaked by repentaunce. <hi>M.</hi> For except we be affected with the féeling of our ſinnes, the largeneſſe of Gods grace ſhalbe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to vs in vaine. For this cauſe the Preaching of repentaunce was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to go before the Goſpel of grace.<note place="margin">Mark. 1.4 15.</note> And it pricketh more, if we be but once admoniſhed of our ſinnes by others, (ſpeciallye of our ſecréete ſinnes) than if the ſame were done ten times in the ſecréeſie of our conſcience. This wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man alſo knew that the Huſband which ſhée had, was not her Huſbande: not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, ſhe could not in the meane time bée brought to repentaunce, by the Prycke of her owne Conſcience: but was driuen therevnto by another mans admonition.</p>

               <p>This commeth to paſſe by the Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:14631:60"/>
of the Goſpell, which leadeth vs to the knowledge of Chriſt. Without this, repentaunce is Preached in vaine. <hi>Bv.</hi> And certainelye, ſo often as the righteous Lorde, reproueth and repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hendeth our ſinnes, he doth it to no other purpoſe, than that we ſhoulde acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge our diſeaſe, and ronne to the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, and bée healed.

               <p>This example of our Sauiour Chriſt, muſt bée followed, where there is hope of repentaunce: where the ſame is not, but by obſtinate impenitencye, the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of trueth is reſiſted, there greater ſeueritye muſt be vſed.</p>

out of thoſe thinges which belong to the true worſhippe of GOD, and ſoules health. For Chriſt aunſwereth not this Woman, ſaying: What matter is it to thée, whether God bée worſhipped in this Mountayne, or at <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> which haſt ſo litle feare of GOD, that thou doſt not abſtaine from committing manifeſt euyll?

               <p>And yet notwithſtanding, in that the Euangeliſt ſayeth, that they durſt not aſke, it is profitable to bee noted. <hi>M.</hi> For it is not the parte of a good Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, raſhlye to examine his Maiſters doinges, but rather to bée ſo perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of his goodneſſe and wiſedome, that hée in no wyſe doubte, but that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer he doeth, is done by excellent rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and wiſedome. <hi>C.</hi> Therefore if at any time ſomething in the wordes, and workes of GOD, and of Chriſte, doeth miſlyke or diſpleaſe vs, let vs learne not to controule, eyther in woorde or thought: but rather mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtlye to kéepe ſilence, vntyll ſuch time as that bée reuealed to vs from heauen, which is hidden from vs. And the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of this modeſtye, is the feare of God, and the reuerence of Chriſt.</p>

                  <hi>M.</hi> The purpoſe of our Sauiour Chriſt was, to call the mindes of the Diſciples from the care of the earthlye Harueſt, vnto that which was more principall, and better agréeing with theyr calling and profeſſion. <hi>R.</hi> Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hée vſeth here a certaine kinde of correction: as if hée ſhould haue ſayd, <hi>Ye ſaye,</hi> that Harueſt is as yet, a farre of, namelye, foure Monethes hence: but I ſaye, that the ſame is nighe. I ſpeake not of the corporall Harueſt, which is foure Monethes of, but of the Spirituall, which is alreadye come.</p>
               <q>Lyfte vp your eyes.</q>
               <p>That is to ſaye, behold and ſée, howe that not the <hi>Iewes</hi> onelye deſyre ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but the <hi>Samaritanes</hi> alſo aſpyre to the Goſpell, and thyrſt after ſaluacion.</p>
               <p>So in like manner, hée ſayeth in another place,<note place="margin">Mat. 9.73.</note> 
                  <hi>The Harueſt is great, but the Labourers are fewe: Praye therefore the Lord of the Harueſt, that hee wyll rhruſt out Labourers into his Harueſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>C.</hi> Therefore, euen as ſoone as the Corne is readye and rype, it maye tarrye no lenger for feare of ſhéeding: euen ſo nowe the ſpyrituall Corne be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Rype, Chriſte ſayeth, that haſte muſt bée made, becauſe delaye is daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous.

                  <hi>M.</hi> This is an argument taken of the reward of the reapers. By the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per hée meaneth, not the Huſbandman him ſelfe, to whome the ſéede belongeth, but the hyred Labourer.

               <p>This is an argument taken of the ioye which the Harueſt commonly brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth with it, and that not onelye to the Reaper, but alſo to him that ſoweth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>C.</hi> For by theſe wordes Chriſt teacheth that it ſhalbe without the complaint and finding faulte of any man, that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles ſhoulde reape the fruite of other mennes earing, and tyllage. <hi>R.</hi> For it is a compariſon betwéene the Prophetes of the olde Teſtament, and the Apoſtles of the Newe. The Prophetes are the ſowers, and the Séede was ſowen in the olde Teſtament. For the ſowing was the Doctrine of the Lawe and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetes: for then the ſéede which was caſt into the grounde, laye as it were hyd: but the Doctrine of the Goſpell, becauſe it bringeth men to perfect ripeneſſe, is apt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye compared to the Harueſt. For the Lawe was farre from that perfection, which at the length was offred in Chriſt. <hi>R.</hi> For the Lawe is our Schoolemai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter vnto Chriſt.<note place="margin">Gal. 2.24.

Wée knowe alſo the compariſon which <hi>Paul</hi> bringeth betwéene the Age of a Childe,<note place="margin">Gala. 4.1.</note> and the full and perfect age: the whiche tendeth to the ſame effect. And yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding this letteth not, but that the Fathers might bée gathered into the Lordes Barne: but the manner of tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching was farre otherwiſe: for as the Childhoode of the Church continued vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyll the ende of the Lawe, and the flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing Youth ſuccéeded the Preaching of the Goſpell: euen ſo then ſaluation began to waxe rype, the which the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetes had onelye ſowen before.</p>
               <p n="37">

               <p>
                  <hi>R.</hi> Therefore the Prophetes are the ſowers, and the Apoſtles are the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers. That which the Prophetes ſowed, the Apoſtles reaped. Alſo, to ſowe, is to Preache the Lawe, and to Preache the Goſpell, is to Reape the offered Chriſt. <hi>C.</hi> For this was a common Prouerbe, by which was meant, that many oftentimes receyued the fruite of other mennes labours. Howbeit this (namelye, that hee which laboureth, is greeued that another man ſhoulde take awaye the fruite of his labour) is other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wyſe, becauſe, the Prophetes and the Apoſtles, were pertakers one of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Ioye. And yet neuertheleſſe, it followeth not herevppon, that the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetes, are witneſſes, or priuye to thoſe thinges, which at this daye are done in the Churche: becauſe the purpoſe of Chriſt tendeth to no other ende, than to ſhewe, that the Prophetes taught with this mind and deſyre, that they might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce ouer that fruite, which they had not leaue to gather.

<pb n="157" facs="tcp:14631:81"/>
hée had done was a diuine worke. That was a ſhadowed Ceremonye, the which Chriſt ended by his comming (as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle teacheth) but the whole ſtate of the cauſe doeth not conſiſt in this point.<note place="margin">Colo. 2.16.</note> For men are commanded to ceaſſe from their workes onelye: and therefore Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion whiche was a diuine worke, and not of men was not againſt the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>both. Chriſt ſtandeth vpon this point that the Sabboth, or holye reſt, which <hi>Moyſes</hi> commaunded, was not broken by diuine workes. And by this reaſon hée doeth not onelye excuſe his owne déede, but him alſo, which tooke vp his bed on his necke: for it was an appendix, or as it were a part of the Myracle, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was nothing but an approbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the ſame.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, if ſo bée the thankſege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing bée reckened among the workes of God, and the ſetting foorth of his glorye alſo, then it was not the prophanation of the Sabboth, to teſtifye the grace of God by féete or handes.

               <p>Neuertheleſſe, hée teſtifyeth that the health which hée had reſtored to the ſicke perſon, was a proofe of his diuine power. Hée preacheth him ſelfe to bée the ſonne of GOD, and that his Father and hee worke all one manner of waye: <hi>PAR,</hi> as if hée ſhoulde ſaye, As the Father be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the obſeruation of the Sabboth, on the which hée is ſayd to reſt from the workemanſhippe of the world, ceaſſeth not to doe good daylye to mortall men, and to all other creatures: euen ſo I which am his ſonne, hauing power and example from him to worke thoſe things which pertaine to the health of mankind, am not let by the obſeruation of the ſab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>both, to finiſhe thoſe thinges which my Father hath commaunded.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>CYR.</hi> For becauſe the ſonne is of the ſame nature that the Father is of, and differreth nothing from him in vnitye of ſubſtaunce, therefore hée cannot wyll a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing contrarye to the wyll of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. For he is the lyuing counſayle, and the ſubſiſting power of his Father, and therefore hée worketh all thinges with the father. <hi>Bv.</hi> If therefore the father by preſeruing, gouerning, and bleſſing, doeth not breake the reſte of the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>both, neyther dyd Chriſt violate the Sabboth in doing good to the miſerable man. <hi>C.</hi> In ſixe dayes the creation of the worlde was finiſhed, but the gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thereof is perpetuall, and GOD doeth continuallye worke in preſeruing and maintaining the order thereof. <hi>C.</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen as the Apoſtle teacheth ſaying,<note place="margin">Acte. 17.28.

                  <hi>C.</hi> That which the Iewes obiected, though it were ſclaunderous, yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, Chriſte is ſo farre from confuting the ſame, that he openly affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth it to be true. <hi>Bv.</hi> For he proueth by ſtrong argumentes, that hée is the naturall ſonne of God, equall to the Father in all thinges, <hi>M.</hi> affirming that his workes are none of his, but the workes of his father, and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Sabboth is not broken by them. Neither doth he ſimplye affirme this, but that which is more, namely that it cannot be that the Sonne ſhould do any thing that the father doeth not. <hi>C.</hi> And firſt of all, he ſtandeth vppon this poynte, that the ſame was a diuine worke which the Iewes founde fault withall, to the ende they might knowe that they muſte contende with God, yf ſo be they condemne that, which of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie muſt be aſcribed vnto him.</p>

Alſo, If I beare witneſſe of my ſelfe, my witneſſe is not true,</hi> are ſpoken by imitation. Hitherto the Lorde imitated the Iewes, who thought him not to be all one with the father, and yet notwithſtanding he was of ſome ſubſtaunce with the father, &amp; made man after the wil of his father, inſomuch that he neither thought nor did any thing, which was not both the wil and worke of his father. Alſo this place the <hi>Arrian</hi> hath abuſed, ſeking to proue here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by that the ſonne is leſſe then the father. But there is no mencion here made of the bare diuinitie of Chriſte: neyther doth that which followeth ſymplye be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the eternall worde of God: but doth onely belong to the ſonne of God, in that he was manifeſted in the fleſhe. And his purpoſe is to declare by theſe wordes, that they doe greatlye erre, which thinke that they haue to do with a mortall man, when they accuſe Chriſte concerning diuine workes.

to the ende that nothing might be left to the working father, which the ſonne in like manner worketh not.</p>
               <p>

C.</hi> But Chriſt ſpeaketh here as a mediatour, leaſt any man ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre it to that internall loue of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinitye.

Yea, wée knowe that hée was diſceuered as wel from Angels, as from men by this no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table title, <hi>This is my beloued ſonne. &amp;c.</hi> For wée knowe that Chriſt,<note place="margin">Mat. 3.17. Mat. 17.5.</note> in whome the whole loue of God ſhould reſt, was elected, that from thence, as from a flowing well, it might flowe vnto vs. For Chriſt is loued of the father, as hée is the head of the Churche.

               <p>
                  <hi>CYR.</hi> Therefore the father ſheweth vnto the ſonne thoſe thinges which hée doeth, not as paynted or written in Tables, or as teaching him being ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noraunt: (for the ſonne knoweth all thinges as God) but ſo expreſſing him ſelfe whollye in the nature of his ſonne, that whatſoeuer hée hath in him ſelfe, hée ſheweth the ſame in his ſonne.</p>

               <p>Our ſauiour Chriſte doth not without déepe conſideration affirme, that we are alredye eſcaped from death becauſe the ſéede of life by which we are called,<note place="margin">1.

But although that lyfe is but begon in vs, yet neuertheleſſe, Chriſt pronounceth the ſame to be ſo certaine to the faithful, that they ought not to be afraid of death: &amp; no maruaile, they being ingraffed in him which is the bottomleſſe wel of lyfe.</p>

               <p>The effect of faith, of the which Chriſt here ſpeaketh, ſéemeth to be incredible.</p>
               <p>Therefore, by an othe hée affirmeth that the voice of his Goſpell is of ſuch quickening power, that it is able to raiſe vp the dead. <hi>B.</hi> There are ſome whiche vnderſtand this worde of Chriſte, of the reſurrection or life of mens bodyes, &amp; go about to proue the ſame by the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Lazarus,</hi> &amp; of the widdowes ſonne: <hi>C.</hi> but it is euident enough by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> text, that Chriſte doth ſpeake of ſpirituall death. Fyrſt of al, Chriſt admoniſheth vs that we are all dead, before he doth quicken vs. And hereby it appeareth what the whole nature of man is able to dooe, concernyng the attaynyng to ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. It is verye true that there remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth in the ſoule of man, ſome rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of lyfe (for vnderſtanding, iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, will, and all the ſences are partes of life) but becauſe there is no part which may aſpire to life eternall, it is no maruaile yf the whole man, ſo farre forth as appertaineth to the kingdome of God, be counted deade. And of this death the Apoſtle ſpeaketh in more wordes, when he ſaith, that we were farre from the pure and ſincere reaſon of the mind, and in the cogitacion of our hartes ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to God, and his righteouſnes, and being blind, erred in darckneſſe, &amp; were geuen to euyll concupiſcence. If this corrupt nature haue no ſtrength to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne

Not that the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall preaching of the ſame is of ſuche force, (which often times goeth in at one eare, and commeth out at the other) but becauſe Chriſt ſpeaketh within to our hartes by his holy Spirite, that we may by faith receiue the lyfe offered vnto vs. <hi>R.</hi> Therefore to heare the voyce of the Sonne of God, is not onely to heare thoſe carnall wordes with our bodilye eares, but to beléeue with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hart.

Rom. 10.10 Gen. 15.6. Abacc. 2.4.</note> Alſo it is ſayde, <hi>Abraham beleeued God, and that was imputed to him for righteouſneſſe.</hi> Againe it is ſayd <hi>the iuſt shall liue by faith.</hi> For Chriſte doth not ſpeake here of dead men, but he only vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth the elect, whoſe eares God doeth open, that they may receiue the voyce of his Sonne, which can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoore them to life.

               <p>The readers of the Scriptures muſt bée ſearchers, and not corrupters, wreſters, dreamers, or ſuperſticious murmurers.<note place="margin">Howe the ſcriptures ought to be read.</note> And the Scriptures do not require any ſearching, but that whiche is godlye, humble, and deſirous to knowe and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace one trueth onely: otherwiſe a man maye finde ſome which reade the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, but not to ſearche out Gods truth, but rather to hinder the ſame.

               <p>For the wicked do detracte from the worde of God, and doe eſteeme the ſame as nothing, becauſe they are not touched with the reuerence thereof: and a great many weake and ignoraunt men doe doubte whether that be the word of God or noe which is reiected of the moſt parte of the worlde. For this ſtumbling blocke Chriſt prouideth, when he deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth thoſe to be his, which beleue not. If to ſuche the trueth of God be vnſauory: it is no marueyle but all the children of God imbrace the ſame.</p>
               <p>Firſt of all we gather oute of thys place, that the benefite of faith commeth of the free gift of God the Father, not of humaine ſtrengthe. Whomeſoeuer the father hath geuen to the ſonne: come to the Sonne.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>C.</hi> Therefore faith is not in the wil of men that this or that man may beléeue without exception,<note place="margin">Fayth is the gift of God.</note> as it were by chaunce but God choſeth them, whom he delyue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth to the Sonne as it were from hand to hande.</p>
               <p>For when he ſaith, <hi>All that is geuen</hi> we maye gather, that all are not geuen. Moreouer we gather that GOD doeth worke in his elect with ſo greate efficacy of the Spirite that none of them do fall awaye from him. For this worde of ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing is as muche as if Chriſte had ſayde thoſe whome the Father hath choſen he doth regenerate, and addicteth them to me in the obedience of the Goſpell.</p>

But otherſome expound it of the wicked only, whiche did eate <hi>Manna</hi> withoute fayth of the trueth, in the whiche is lyfe, and therefore are alſo deade: that is to ſaye, they periſhed euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſtingly.</p>
               <p>But it ſéemeth not neceſſarye that wée here diſtinguiſhe betwéene the beléeuing and the vnbeléeuing Iewes. <hi>C</hi> Onelye Chriſt ſayth that Manna was a corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible meate to their Fathers, <hi>M.</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing foode not of the ſoule, but of the body, not ſempiternall, but temporall, which coulde not ſaue them from death. <hi>C.</hi> It followeth therefore that mens ſoules finde foode no where but in him, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they maye be fedde into euerlaſting lyfe.<note place="margin">1.

               <p>For the lyfe of the vnbeléeuing is not the true lyfe, but a falſe imagination of lyfe, and a mere phantaſie, by which they thinke themſelues to lyue aloane, when as indéede they are ſtarcke deade.</p>
               <p>Wee muſt alſo noate the vniuerſall formes of ſpeaking, when he ſayth, <hi>If any man eate.</hi> For by this manner of ſpeache hée meaneth that hée is offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to all men, inſomuch that whoſoeuer vſeth hym, ſhall be preſerued in lyfe.</p>

               <p>Becauſe this ſecrete powre of geuing lyfe, concerning whiche, he ſpake, might be referred to his diuine eſſens, he nowe deſcendeth to the ſecond degrée, and tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth that lyfe is included in his fleſhe that men from thence maye drawe the ſame vnto them.<note place="margin">Lyfe is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in the fleſh of Chriſt.</note> It is the wonderfull counſayle of God verily, that he hath ſet before vs lyfe in that fleſhe, in the which before there was nothinge but the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and cauſe of death</p>

               <p>Wherevppon the Apoſtle teſtifieth that he woulde not ſeeme to knowe any other thing, than Ieſus and the ſame crucefied. For the ſatiſfaction of oure ſynnes was made vppon the Croſſe, the which was the ſatiſfaction of Gods righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe, the appeaſing of the Fathers wrath, and the gate of immortalitye. Herevpon to ſhewe, howe he woulde fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhe oure ſaluation, and with what fayth we muſt eate him, he ſayth that the breade which he will geue vnto thoſe that are hys is his owne fleſhe. <hi>C.</hi> But this ſéemeth not to belong to the nature of fleſhe, that it ſhoulde quicken and geue lyfe to mens ſoules. I anſwere although this vertue doth come from ſome other thinge then from fleſhe, yet notwithſtanding there is no let, but that thys name maye be aptly geuen to the ſame.</p>
               <p>For as the eternall worde of God is the well of lyfe, euenſo hys fleſhe, as a water pipe, doth poure lyfe into vs, which reſteth in the diuinitie. And in this ſence, it is called liuing or quickening, becauſe it doth geue vnto vs that lyfe whiche it doth borrowe from another.</p>
               <p>

               <q>And the breade which I will giue (ſayth hee) is my fleſhe.</q>
               <p>Therefore lyfe conſiſteth not neither in the oblations of beaſtes, neither in any mortall mans fleſhe, but only in the fleſhe of Chriſt. <hi>C.</hi> This word <hi>(Geue)</hi> is dyuerſlye taken: the firſte geuing of the whiche Chriſte at the firſte made mencion, is dayly to be ſéene ſo often as Chriſte offereth hym ſelfe to vs: In the ſecond place he noateth that donati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on onely whiche was made vppon the Croſſe, when he offered him ſelfe a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice to the Father, and an oblation of a ſwéete ſmell vnto God.<note place="margin">Ephe. 5.2</note> 
                  <hi>C.</hi> For then he gaue hym ſelfe to death for the lyfe of men: and nowe he inuiteth vs to taſte the frute of hys death. For that offering once offered ſhoulde nothing at all profite vs, except wée did nowe eate the ſame in the holy ſupper. <hi>Bv.</hi> Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when he ſayth that he will geue the ſame for the lyfe of the worlde, his mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning is this: I will geue my ſelfe too death, that the worlde by my death may

               <p>For the worlde is deade in ſinnes but the ſonne of God dyed in the fleſhe, leaſt the ſecond death ſhould raigne ouer the faithful. And thus the ſonne of God doeth quicken. <hi>C.</hi> And this is to bée no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that Chriſt taketh vnto him the part of offering vp his fleſhe.</p>

If they be wordes of contempt, then they haue this meaning: Why doeſt thou glorye and boaſt ſo much before vs of thy ſelfe: if thou be ſuche a manner of man as thou braggeſt thy ſelfe to be, why doeſt thou not goe into <hi>Iury,</hi> where there are men boath mightie, noble, and holye, and alſo learned and wiſe.

               <p>But if thou will haue theſe wordes ſpoken wiſelye for good aduice, than this is the ſcence: Becauſe nowe the feaſt of Tabernacles was at hande, at which time a great multitude came vp to Ieruſalem, according to the lawe the kinſemen of Chriſt tooke counſayle to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither among themſelues, that when Chriſt ſhoulde ſéeme to handle his mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters fearefully and without diſcretion they woulde exhorte hym for kindredes ſake, not to neglect his fame, but to goe vp with them at the feaſt daye, wherby hée ſhoulde confirme his aucthoritye be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Iewes, which hée had partelye gotten alreadie by hys myracles.

kiſemen.</p>
               <p>They ſaye therefore, Why doeſt thou lurke here ſo obſcurelye? whome doeſt thou feare? why doeſt thou ſo vndiſcréetelye handle thy buſineſſe? Wée for the naturall loue whiche wée owe vnto thée, earneſtlye exhorte thée, that thou go vp with vs to Ieruſalem at the feaſte daye, to confirme and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooue thine aucthoritie there, that thy glorye may be more famous, and that thou mayeſt winne a greater num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Diſciples, boath by thy doctrine and alſo by thy miracles. For wée ſée that thou doeſt many greate and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull thinges, but yet not ſo wiſelye as thou ſhouldeſt, becauſe thou with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draweſt thy ſelfe from the multitude and greateſt companye of men, and ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt hidde in a corner of <hi>Galilee,</hi> where thou canſt haue no glorye or prayſe of men.</p>
               <p>If ſo bée the workes which thou doeſt be altogither deuine, thou ſhalt not feare the light, but ſhalt goe with vs to the feaſt, that thou mayeſt bée the more famous and honorable. <hi>C.</hi> For ſéeing thou art indued with ſo greate vertue and power that thou canſt win Fame by working ſignes and wonders, looſe not the ſame: for thou doeſt in vaine ſpende and beſtowe here, thoſe giftes whiche GOD hath giuen vnto thée, where there are no méete witneſſes and Iudges of the ſame. <hi>B.</hi> For hée which woulde haue all men to ſpeake frée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye and openlye of him, muſt doe thoſe noble actes which hée doth openlye, and not in ſecrete. Therefore make thy ſelfe knowne vnto the worlde.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>B.</hi> Hereby wée perceyue how great the dulneſſe of men is, in waying and conſidering the workes of GOD. For the kinſemen of our Sauiour Chriſt woulde neuer haue ſpoken thus, except they had vtterlye contemned and deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed thoſe manifeſt ſignes and proofes of his deuine power, which they ought to haue receyued &amp; reuerenced with great admiration.</p>
               <p>That whiche wée here in this place concerning Chriſt doth daylye happen: For they which ought to be friendelye boath for néereneſſe of bloude, and alſo for other cauſes are more gréeuous and troubleſome to the children of GOD than ſtraungers, oftentimes. For they are the inſtruments of Sathan, to draw and entiſe them, which would ſcincere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye and faythfully ſerue GOD, one while to ambition, another whil to coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſſe, to the loue of the worlde, and to ſuch lyke. Concerning the which matter reade more in our expoſition of Mathew.</p>
               <p>But Chriſt ſharpelye repelling ſuche Sathans, teacheth vs by his example,<note place="margin">Mat. 10.36</note> not to followe the fooliſhe willes and mindes of brethren.</p>

               <p>The Scribes and high Prieſtes were inflamed with hatered againſt hym, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he had healed the man ſicke of the paulſey: the whiche they profeſſed they did of the zeale and loue whiche they bare vnto the lawe.

But this defence was not ſufficient to prooue his cauſe. For ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit that they vſe a falſe pretence to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer their hatred, yet notwithſtanding it doth not follow that Chriſt did well if he committed any thing contrary to the preſcripte Lawe. For we cannot excuſe oure owne falts by excuſing other men. But Chriſt here Ioyneth two members together. With the firſte he ſtriketh the conſiences of his enemies: and when they proudly boaſted them ſelues to bée the Patrones and defenders of the lawe he plucked from their faces this viſor and hipocriticall ſhewe.

               <p>Of this Law Chriſt putteth the Iewes in minde, that in this cauſe concerning the breaking of the Sabboth,<note place="margin">Iuſt iudge<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ment.</note> they ſhould not with reſpect of perſons, neyther with enuie, nor with fauour, iudge but with iuſt iudgement, that is to ſay, the only cauſe conſidered. <hi>Bv,</hi> As if hée ſhould ſaye, in iudging of my déede, yée muſt not follow the affection of anger nor of hatred, but equitie, and the minde of the Lawe.

               <p>Furthermore Circumciſion was iuſtely reuerenced among them. When the ſame was done vppon the Sabboth daye, they knew that the Law was not broken, becauſe the workes of GOD among themſelues doe rightlye agrée.</p>
               <p>And why doe they not ſo thinke of Chriſtes work, but onely becauſe a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyued preiudice of the perſon, poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth their mindes: therefore the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhall neuer be right, except it bée moderated by the truth of the matter.</p>
               <p>For ſo ſoone as the perſons come in ſight, they bende their eyes and ſcences vppon them,<note place="margin">Preiudice in iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> ſo that truth quight vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheth awaye. <hi>R.</hi> The Iewes excuſed <hi>Moyſes</hi> becauſe of the aucthoritie of the perſon, of the breaking of the Sabboth, although by his decree, and by the decrée of the Fathers alſo, an infaunte might be circumſiſed, and ſacrifices killed: and they accuſed Chriſt, becauſe of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt and baſeneſſe of the perſon, who by the ſame example of <hi>Moſes,</hi> had not cut of a mannes member, but had hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the whole man on the Sabboth day.</p>
               <p>Therefore Chirſt reuoketh them to the rule of right iudgement. <hi>C.</hi> The which admonicion ought to take place in all cauſes and matters, but moſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie it is when wée haue to doe with deuine and heauenlye matters.

               <p>And it is to be noated that Chriſte ſayde not, I will not haue you ſimply to iudge of my facte: for I am the Lorde of all things, and am ſubiect to no mans iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ement: but he ſayde, <hi>Iudge not after the outewarde apperaunce, but Iudge with a righteouſe Iudgement.</hi>

               <p>For this worde (diſperſed) will not aptly agrée and appertayne to thoſe that were borne and doe inhabite their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue countrie, but it doth very well ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertayne to the Iewes whiche are ron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agates and baniſhed men.

For it is lykelye that then the ſeruantes and ſouldiers which were ſent forth to take him, were ready to laye handes on hym. <hi>Bv.</hi> Therefore in the greateſt aſſemblies and in the moſte daungerouſe perilles Ieſus commeth fourth in the middeſt, and with a conſtant mynde geueth Teſtimony to the trueth teaching by his example, what is the office of the ſeruauntes of Chriſte, and of the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of Churches. <hi>C.</hi> Furthermore we muſt noate that he withſtoode their violent rage which were of greate force by the mightie power and defence of God only. <hi>Bv.</hi> He ſtoode, conſtantly to defende a ſeriouſe and moſte graue mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, appertayning to all men. <hi>M.</hi> At other tymes for the moſt parte he was wont to ſit and teache. Now, becauſe the ende of the feaſte was come, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that ſolemne and Catholique Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon of Iſraell was to be diſſolued, he is more feruent, and doth with a ſtrong and ſerious crye, commend to the people which were ready to depart, that which they ſhould carry home with them more déepely to conſider and to ruminate. <hi>Bv.</hi> For his crying now, was not only a playne and ſencible ſpeache, but alſo a loude voyce, thereby declaring that the matter was ſo great, that all men ought to geue eare to the ſame. <hi>C,</hi> This alſo is very profitable for vs, that the Euan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſt bringeth in chriſt crying here with full mouth, that all which thirſt ſhould come vnto him, For herby wée gather that not one or two are called with ſome ſofte voyce ſecretly, but that this doctrine is ſo openly proclaimed to all men, that no man can be ignorant of the ſame, but he which willingly ſtoppeth his eares, and will not heare ſo loude and ſhrill a crye.</p>
               <q>Jf any man thirſte.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>M.</hi> Chriſt comprehendeth the whole ſumme of our ſaluation, in a Paraboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call kynde of ſpeache. For Chriſt ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth not of bodily thirſte, which is quen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched with water, but of the thirſte of
ſoules, and of heauenlye grace. For the thirſte of ſoules is that gredye de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſier of heauenly grace,<note place="margin">Thirſte which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth to ſoules.</note> by which conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces burthened with ſin are afflicted and troubled.</p>

                  <hi>C.</hi> Therefore he exhorteth all to the participation of his goodneſſe, ſo that they knowing and feeling their owne nede deſyer to be holpen, For we are all nedy, bare and voyde of goodneſſe, but the feling of that nede, doth not mooue al men to ſéeke for remedy. Herevppon it commeth to paſſe that many not once moouing their foote, doe miſerably pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhe: naye, many féele not their néede, vntill the Spirit of God with his heate doe cauſe a hongar and thirſt to ariſe in their hartes.</p>
               <p>Therefore the office of the holy ghoſte is, to make vs to deſier his grace. Hée rather calleth thoſe that thirſte than the hongary.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bv.</hi> For wée can worſe abyde thirſte than hongar, becauſe the heate whiche is within vs, whereby the thirſt is kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, doth more vex and bite vs than dryneſſe, whereby hongar dyeth, and is more weakened. Very well and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningly therefore is the affliction of a troubled conſcience oppreſſed with ſinne thus deſcribed. Morouer there is nothing that doth ſo much recreate and refreſhe a man pyning and withering awaye with thirſte, as doeth cleare water dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen out of a liuely ſpring: euenſo that Ioye of the minde whiche the faithfull man receiueth by the conſolation of the Goſpell, cannot be ſufficiently expreſſed in wordes. <hi>C.</hi> There is no doubt alſo but that he alludeth to the place of the Prophete <hi>All ye that thirſte come vnto the water. &amp;c.</hi>

Furthermore, Chriſt doeth not here name any certaine place of Scripture: but taketh his teſtimony out of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men Doctrine of the Prophetes. For ſo often as the Lorde promiſing the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boundaunce of the ſpirite, doth compare the ſame to lyuing water,<note place="margin">Water of lyfe is Chriſt.</note> hee hath ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all reſpect to the kingdome of Chriſt, and thyther directeth the mindes of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.

               <p>They name the phariſeis for that they excelled others in knoweledge and in holyneſſe, ſo that they were counted the Princes of Princes. <hi>M.</hi> But firſte of all they teſtifie againſt them ſelues that they beléeue not in the Sonne of God, when as they ſhoulde haue béen the firſt of all other, whiche ſhould haue imbra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced Gods truth.</p>

The Papiſtes vſing the ſame weapons at this day, are no leſſe outragious than were the aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries of Chriſt and of the Prophetes in oulde time.</p>
               <p>This is horrible and fearfull blynd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe that a mortall man dare preſume to ſette himſelfe againſte God.

               <p>For it is the principall poynt of the Lawe to knowe ſynne, and to imbrace the grace of God propounded and offered in Chriſte.

               <p>
                  <hi>C.</hi> There is alſo another cauſe why they pronounce the people to bée accur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. They pretende the ignoraunce of the Lawe: but there was another cauſe, namely, for that they thought there was no hollineſſe but in their owne order.</p>

               <p>And this playne and effectuall doctrine of the Lorde, wanted not her fruite in the Churche.</p>

them ſelues to his word: ſo ſone as they beganne to beléeue, they conceyued fayth by the hearing of the worde of the Lord, as the Euangeliſt alſo taught, when hée ſayde,<note place="margin">Rom. 10.17</note> 
                  <hi>As hee spake theſe thinges many beleeued on him.</hi> So the Apoſtle ſayth, that fayth commeth by hearing, and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring by the worde of God. Secondly,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
if ſo bée fayth commeth by hearing of the worde of the Lord, and if it bée our part to abyde in the ſame, and that we ought not to beléeue any other thing, than the verye ſame which is ſet before vs by the worde, whereby we conceyue Faith, and in beleeuing, the whiche wée abyde: howe fooliſhe are they which at this daye ſaye they knowe not, what they ought to beléeue, and what not?</p>
               <p>If ſo be they were abyding in the word of the Lorde, they ſhould knowe what to beléeue: But becauſe they haue already applyed their eares and mind to humane doctrine, it commeth to paſſe that they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ignoraunt of Gods truth, are caryed about with euery winde of doctrine: the which the Apoſtle forbiddeth.</p>
               <p>Thirdlye, this alſo is manifeſt,<note place="margin">Eph. 4.14.</note> in what, Chriſtian fayth ought to bée main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayned and confirmed, when he ſayeth,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>

For as when the Scripture calleth vs the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God, the ſame doeth not belong to the originall of ſubſtaunce, but to the grace of the ſpyrite, which doeth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate vs to newneſſe of lyfe: euen ſo this ſaying of Chriſt, doeth nothing ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaine to the originall of ſubſtaunce but to the corruption of nature, the cauſe and originall whereof is the fall of man.

               <p>
                  <hi>C.</hi> Chriſt expreſſeth what thoſe deſires are, which the vngodly of their owne ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corde and mind followe and he repeateth two kindes, namely Crueltie and liyng in the which thinges the Iewes weare too lyke to the Deuell. In that he ſayth, <hi>He was a murtherer,</hi> he geueth vs to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtande that he ſought mans deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. For ſo ſoone as man was created, Sathan had a wicked deſier to hurt him inſomuch that he went about with all his might to deſtroye hym, <hi>Bv.</hi> and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king error and rebellion in our parents <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eue</hi> he ſlue all mankinde.

               </p>
               <p>And dayly throughout the whoale world he ſtirreth vp wicked and vngod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly men to murther. For he reioyceth in bloud, in warres, in theft, and in the deſtruction of men: and only becauſe hee enuieth the felicitie and happineſſe of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. But Chriſt meaneth not here the beginning of the creation, as though God had endewed the Deuell with a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſier to hurte, but he condemneth the wickedneſſe of Sathans nature whiche he hath taken to him ſelfe. <hi>M.</hi> Ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ought it to ſéeme abſurd to any man that the Deuell is ſayde to be the autor of death, when as notwithſtanding the Apoſtle ſéemeth to attribute the ſame to our firſte parent, ſaying, <hi>As by one man ſinne entereth into the worlde, and by ſinne Death. &amp;c.</hi> For theſe two went together, namely the Temptor, and the Obayer of Temptacion. Sathan was the Temptor and perſwador to tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion and ſinne by enuie mixing with the ſame a lye: yet notwithſtanding hée had fayled of his purpoſe, if ſo be <hi>Adam</hi> had not harckned to his perſwaſion, and tranſgreſſed Gods commaundement, Therefore as touching that enuie of the Deuell the roote of euell temtation, and alſo as touching the lye of perniciouſe perſwaſyon, it is truely attributed to the Deuell that hée is the firſte au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of death: againe, as touching the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of <hi>Adam,</hi> and the tranſgreſſion of Gods commaundement, it is rightly by the Apoſtle aſcribed to <hi>Adam</hi> that he was the author of ſynne and death to all his poſteritie, inſomuch that there is no diſagréement at all here betwene Chriſt and the Apoſtle.</p>
               <p>As for example, if ſo bee amonge the enemies beſieging a Cittie one of them doe with ſertaine falſe perſwaſyons perſwade and intice one of the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall Cittizens to betraye the Cittie vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, inſomuche that he harkeneth therevnto, whereby be boath betrayeth his Countrey, and alſo maketh the Cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to be ſacked and deſtroyed: boath the perſwading enemie, and alſo the betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Cittizen which contemning the falſe perſwaſions of the enemie might haue kepte his fayth whiche he did owe vnto his countrey, are rightly ſayd to be the aucthours of this deſtruction. Euenſo the mortalitie of mankinde is aptly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to the mallice and enuie of the Deuell, but yet not without the falt of our parentes.

                  <hi>C.</hi> Theſe wordes playnly expreſſe a chaung and alteration to the worſe: and therefore Sathan is a lyer, not from the creation: but becauſe he fell from the trueth.</p>
               <p>Therefore in that he is a lyer, it is not becauſe he hath bene alwayes by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture an ennemy to the truth, but becauſe he fell voluntarily from the ſame. <hi>Bv.</hi> God made the Deuell good in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, for all his workes are good.

he aboade not in the trueth- that is to ſay in the puritie in the which he was made.</p>
               <p>For by Infedilitie he fell. <hi>C.</hi> This diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cription of Sathan is very profitable for vs that euery man maye learne to bée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of his ſubtill ſnares,<note place="margin">1.

               <p>
                  <hi>AVG.</hi> We haue not red that the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell hath at any time vſed any externall armoure to kill a man, neyther that hée hath playde the murderer with his hand but he hath vſed lying and pernicious perſwaſion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>M.</hi> This is the worſe and moſte Deueliſhe kinde of murther, when the body is not only killed with the ſworde but alſo when both ſoule and body, with a blaſphemouſe lye againſt the worde of God, is made ſubiect not only to Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral but alſo to euerlaſting death. <hi>C.</hi> So much the more therefore it behooueth the Faithfull to be armed with ſpirituall armoure to fighte, and to be ſober and watche. <hi>M.</hi> Therefore the Apoſtle when he feared this kinde of murther ſayde, <hi>I feare leſte by any meanes, that as the ſerpent beguiled Eue through his ſubteltie,</hi>

               <p>For the ſerpent had the falſe Apoſtles Miniſters of this murder, by whoſe dil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence he ſought to bryng to paſſe that thing whiche he had begon in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to the deſtruction of mankind: ſuch falſe Apoſteles he hath alwayes had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Gentiles, among the Iewes, and amonge the Chriſtians.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>C.</hi> Therefore yf Sathan cannot put of this affection, there is no cauſe why we ſhoulde he troubled as at ſome newe or ſtraunge thing, when we ſée diuers errors to ſpring vp: for Sathan ſendeth forth his Inſtrumentes to trouble and to deceiue the worlde. And it is noe marueile yf ſo be Sathan ſéeke ſo dilli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently to ouerwhelme the light of the trueth: for it is the onely lyfe of the ſoul Therefore he vſeth lying as a mortall darte to deſtroye the ſoule.</p>

Wherefore there are two thinges here to be noated: the firſt is, that iudgement doth often times beginne at the houſe of GOD: and that hee ouerpaſſing the wicked doth ſeuere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye puniſhe hys ſeruauntes, and doth more ſharpelye ſcourge in correcting the vices of his Churche.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="335" facs="tcp:14631:172"/>The ſecond is, that there are diuers endes why he aflicted men. For he ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered Peeter and Paule to be executed by the cruell tormenter no leſſe then yf they had béene wicked théeues. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we gather that in the puniſhmentes of men the cauſes of the ſame, cannot be well diſcerned. <hi>M.</hi> Moreouer this ſo abſurd a queſtion of the diſciples came of the common opinion at that time, namely, that the ſoule of this blynd man had ſinned before in ſome other man, by the deſert whereof he was blind in body from his natiuitie. <hi>C.</hi> For it euedently appeareth by other places of Scripture that the reiterated or ſecond generation which <hi>Pithagoras</hi> taught, was beléeued and receiued of them. Hereby wee ſée what a déepe Labyrinth the curioſity of men is, ſpecially when preſumtuouſe bouldneſſe is ioyned therewith. They ſawe ſome to be borne Lame, ſome ſqinte eyed, and ſome ſtarke blinde, and other ſome monſterouſe in body: Nowe when they ought to haue reuerenced the Iudgementes of God, they woulde in theſe workes haue ſene a manifeſt cauſe, and they alleaged that, of the which wée ſpake euen nowe. And the Iewes are not aſhamed at this daye to maintayne in their Sinagoges ſuch a foule errour, for a diuine and heauenly oracle. By the which example we are taught, dilligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to take hede leſt yf we paſſe the bonds of ſobrietie in ſearching out the Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes of God, the wandering error of the minde doe carry and caſt vs into hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible confuſion.</p>

               <p>The ſpeciall cauſe why this man was borne blind was, that occaſion might bee geuen to ſet forth the glory of God, and not eyther his ſinne or the ſinne of hys Parentes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>M.</hi> For this man was appoynted from euerlaſting, to miniſter occaſion by his blindneſſe to the Sonne of God, to manifeſt the workes of his Father: the which manifeſtation appertayneth to the glory of God. <hi>R.</hi> Chriſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore teacheth that although all men are ſinners yet notwithſtanding all afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons come not by the merite and deſert of ſynnes.</p>
               <p>For God afflicteth men for diuers reſpectes: ſometime he puniſheth them for their ſinnes, and ſometime he afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth them for his glory.<note place="margin">Pſal. i30.</note> If hee haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to ſynnes, and to the deſert of Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie, there is no puniſhment ſo great with the whiche we are not Iuſtly afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, ſo many of vs as haue had our origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall from Adam.</p>
               <p>For if the Lorde be extreame to marke what is done amiſſe, who ſhalbe able to abide it.</p>
               <p>But yf he haue reſpect vnto his glory, he afflicteth not for ſynne, but to the ſetting forth of his glory. So he afflicted <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> and the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> in <hi>Egipt,</hi> that he might be honored in affliction: that is to ſay that God might be openly known to bee a helper and deliuerer in trybula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>C.</hi> So that when we knowe not the cauſes of afflictions, we muſt not bée to curiouſe, leſte we be boath iniuriouſe vnto God, and alſo towardes oure Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theren.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>R.</hi> Furthermore, we muſt noate, that calamities do not happen vnto vs by chaunce, but by the will of God, that at the length he maye bée glorified. Wherefore hée which reiecteth the croſſe through impatience, reiecteth the glory of God.</p>
               <q>But that the workes of GOD.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>C.</hi> Hée doth not ſaye, one worke but workes in the plurall nomber. For ſo long as this blynde man was blynde, Gods ſeueritie was to bée ſéene in hym, whereby others might learne to feare and to humble them ſelues. Afterward followed the benefite of deliueraunce, in the which the wonderfull goodneſſe of God did appeare.</p>
               <p>Wherefore Chriſte by theſe wordes went aboute to make his Diſciples to hope for the ſyght of the Miracle: but yet he admoniſheth them generally, that this cauſe ought to ſéeme Iuſt and lawe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ynough in this worlde when God ſetteth forth his name.</p>
               <p>And there is noe cauſe why men ſhoulde diſpute with God, ſéeing he hath made them inſtrumentes of his glory eyther waye, whether he bée mercifull or ſeuere.</p>

               <p>For when Luther and ſuche lyke re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued in the beginning the groſſer ſorte of abuſes of the Pope, he had ſmall, or almoſt no féeling at all of pure Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aniſme.</p>
               <p>But after the Pope had thondered out his curſes agaynſt them, and when they were caſt forth of the Sinagogue of Rome by terrible Bulles, Chriſt reached forth his hande vnto them, and made him ſelfe fully knowen vnto them.</p>
               <p>Thus we ſée that there can be nothing better for vs than to be fartheſt from the enemies of Chriſt, that he maye approch more nere vnto vs. <hi>C.</hi> For to be eiec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of the Phariſeis is to be ioyned vnto Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Therefore they which ſuffer anye re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proche or euill for the truthes ſake of Chriſt, are moſt ſpeciallye honoured of GOD. For as hée which ſpendeth his money for Gods ſake, ſhall finde them, and hee which hateth his ſoule doth moſt of all loue the ſame: euen ſo hée which ſuffereth reproch for Gods ſake, is much honoured of God. <hi>Bv.</hi> Yea it is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie, that they bée firſt condemned and caſt foorth of the companye and congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of infidels, which will or deſire to be receyued of Chriſt, and to be in the number of his Diſciples. For except thou departe from Antechriſt and from the wicked, Chriſt will neuer receyue thée, and the congregation of the ſaintes will not acknowledge thée, For whome the Phariſeicall pride reiecteth, Chriſt receyueth and imbraceth. For to be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded from the communion and felow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippe of the wicked, is to be ioyned vnto Chriſt: and to be condemned of thoſe which ſéeking to eſtabliſh falſe righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, doe reſiſt the true righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of God, is to be approued: alſo to be reproched and abaſed by thoſe which ſeeke theyr owne glorye, to obſcure the glorye of Chriſt, is great prayſe and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye: and to receyue curſynges of the accurſed, is to be bleſſed of Goo. <hi>Bv.</hi> Let them therefore reioyſe and be glad in Chriſt, whome the wrath of the By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoppes of Rome hath curſed for recey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the Goſpell.

For he doeth not properly blynde any man by his owne nature: but becauſe the reprobate doe deſyer nothing more than to extinguiſh his light, it is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary that the eyes of their mindes which are infected with mallice and wickednes be darckened and ſhut vp by the light offered vnto them. In fine, forſomuch as Chriſt by his owne nature is the light of the worlde, this is accidentall that ſome by his comming be made blynd. By the waye of graunting he calleth thoſe which ſée, Ironicée vnbeléeuing: béecauſe they béeing blinde, do thinke them ſelues very quicke ſyghted and wiſe, and béeing puf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed vp with this truſte they will not voutſafe to heare the voyce of God: and without Chriſte the wiſedome of the
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:14631:184"/>
fleſhe hath a gloriouſe ſhewe: becauſe the worlde doth not knowe what it is to bée wiſe in déede. Therefore Chriſt ſayeth that they do ſée which deceiuing themſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues and others vnder the fooliſh truſte of wiſedome, are caried awaye with their owne ſence and do make account of their owne Immaginations as of wiſedome. Such, ſo ſoone as Chriſte appeareth in the brightneſſe of his Goſpell, are blind not only becauſe their fooliſhneſſe is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered which before laye hid vnder the darckenes of Infidelity but alſo becauſe they béeing plunged by the Iuſte venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aunce of God in déeper darckeneſſe, doe looſe that litle light which was left vnto them.</p>
               <p>Wée are all borne blynde: but yet for al that in the darckeneſſe of corrupt &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed nature, there appeareth ſtill ſertain ſparckes, that men maye differ from brute beaſtes.</p>
               <p>Nowe yf proude reaſon béeing puffed vp with truſte and confydence of it ſelfe, do refuſe to ſubmit it ſelfe vnto God, it ſhall ſeeme to be wiſe without Chriſte: but the bryghtnes of Chriſt at the length ſhall make the ſame fooliſhneſſe: becauſe then the vanitie of mans minde doeth begin to appeare when heauenly wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome doth reueale it ſelfe. But our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uioure Chriſt had a farther matter to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe in theſe wordes. For ypocrites be fore Chriſt doth ſhine, do not ſo obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately reſiſt and withſtande God: but ſo ſoone as the Light doth ſhine more nere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, they doe make open warre againſte God.</p>
               <p>This wickedneſſe and Ingratitude bringeth to paſſe that their blindneſſe is doubled, and that God which before had but taken awaye the light from their eyes, doth nowe thruſte them oute al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together</p>
               <p>Now let vs noate the ſumme of this place, which is that Chriſt came into the worlde, to illuminate the blynde, to bring thoſe quight and cleane oute of their wittes which ſéeme wiſe in their owne conceites.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>M.</hi> It is no merueile therefor yf the Phariſeis ſaw not that which this blind man ſawe, when they ſayde that Chriſte was of God, whome the blinde man, and ſimple Idiots, in the ſight of the world, knewe to come from God: becauſe by the iuſt Iudgement of God thoſe wiſe men are blinded by the comming of Chriſte, and thoſe which ſawe not, of blind, are made to ſée. <hi>C.</hi> And in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer place Chriſt made mencion of illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, becauſe this is the proper cauſe of his comming.

               <p>Wherefore (becauſe they were puft vp with Pride) they thinking that they ſhoulde receiue greate iniury, yf ſo bée they were reckoned among the blynd, burſt forth and ſaye.</p>

               <p>For there is not a more peſtilent plague to the Church, than when wolues créepe in vnder the cloake of paſtoures. Chriſt doth plainly here deny them to be counted for paſtoures, which boaſt that they ought ſo to be taken and accounted of or that they ought to be nombered a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the ſhéepe, which glory in exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall ſignes.</p>
               <p>He ſpeaketh here of the Iudaicall Church: and in this poynt there is noe greate difference betwéene that and oures.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>R.</hi> Chriſt doeth not by naked and bare wordes euen at the firſt teach that he is a ſhepheard, but by this parable ſuſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the mindes of his auditoures, that afterwarde by the expoſition of the ſame he might make that which in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning they heard not without admiration and a deſier to knowe, to ſinke deper into their mindes.</p>

               <p>Some of the fathers were in this poynt to ſtrayght: otherſome were more Indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent, who gaue libertie to Paſtoures to flée in ſuch wiſe, that if ſo be by their flight, they might doe more good to all men than hurt their flocke, they might flee. And they Iudged that this might be when the Church ſhould not be left de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitude of able Miniſters, and when the life of the Paſtoure ſhoulde be ſo aſſaul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of the enemies, that their rage and madneſſe could be appeaced no wayes elſe but by his abſence.

               <p>For as he is not by and by a true ſhepe heard which leadeth forth the ſhéepe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Paſture euenſo he is not ſtraight way a hyerling, which in time of perſecution fléeth for a time.

Paule was not a Hyerling when he taught at <hi>Damaſcus</hi> and preached Chriſt, therefore by fleing hée was not made an hyerling. The hyerling fléeeth for that cauſe (as ſayeth Chriſt) becauſe he is a hyerling, and hath no care for the ſhéepe. For this cauſe Paule did not ſlee, who, if it had ſo ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the Lord, was redy to dye: but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Bretheren did vrge him to flée inſomuch that they did let him downe in a Baſket ouer the wall, he ſled that hée might ſerue Chriſt longer.

                  <hi>B.</hi> This is a digreſſion, by which hée declareth howe hée woulde geue his life for his ſheepe, not that hee ought death any thing, but becauſe he would wyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linglye ſuffer the ſame, that hée might take his lyfe vnto him agayne by his owne power.</p>
               <p>Wherevpon it commeth that he ſayth, <hi>Herein is the loue of my Father decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in mee:</hi> Herein it is certaine that I am loued of my Father, that I geue my life, to take it to me againe.</p>
               <p>For this is deuine power, the whiche being ſéene in mée, who wyll not thinke thereby that I am greatlye loued of my Father? <hi>C.</hi> There is alſo another far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cauſe why the Father loueth the Sonne. For this voice was not heard in vaine from Heauen, <hi>This is my well beloued Sonne in whome I am wel plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</hi> But becauſe for our ſakes alſo hée was made man, and becauſe the father loued him to this ende, that he might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile vs vnto him, it is no maruaile if he affirme that he is therefore loued, becauſe our ſaluacion was dearer vnto him than his owne lyfe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bv.</hi> Hereby certainlye, it is euident that the Sonne dyed with the good wyll of his Father, and that the wyll and purpoſe of them boathe was all one in redéeming the worlde. <hi>C.</hi> This there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is a wonderfull commendation of the goodneſſe of God, which geueth vs iuſt occaſion to wonder at him, in that hée doeth not onely powre out his loue into vs, but alſo referreth the ſame vnto vs, as to the fynall cauſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="375" facs="tcp:14631:192"/>And verilye Chriſt had no néede to take vppon him our fleſhe, in the which hée ſhoulde bée beloued, but onelye that in redéeming of vs it might be a pleadge of his Fatherly mercy.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>M.</hi> And it is not without cauſe that the Lorde maketh mencion here of his fatherlye goodneſſe. For hée went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to beate downe the mallice of the Phariſeis, whiche went about to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade the blinde man, that Chriſt was not of a God, but a ſinner: that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall they might perſwade that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer he ſpake or dyd, was not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable vnto God,
<q>That I might take it to me againe.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>C.</hi> Becauſe the hearing of Chriſtes death might not a litle greeue the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, and might alſo greatelye aſſaye their Faith, he comforteth them with the hope of the reſurrection which ſhould ſtrayte after followe: as if hée ſhoulde ſaye, that he dyd not dye to bee ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed vp of death, but that he might by and by after aryſe a conquerour of death.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>R.</hi> As if he ſhoulde ſaye, Therefore hath GOD the Father glorifyed mée aboue all Creatures, becauſe I am obedient to him,<note place="margin">Phil. 2.8.</note> to the death, euen to the death of the Croſſe.</p>
               <p>For, becauſe I haue deſcended into the lower partes of the earth, and am made the moſte abiecte and contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible performe, therefore I wyll aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cende aboue all the Heauens, and God ſhall geue vnto mée a name whiche is aboue all names, and ſhall greatlye ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>M.</hi> And whereas he aroſe not ſtraite after hee had ſuffered the death of the Croſſe, but tarryed vntyll the thirde daye, it was done, to take awaye the ſuſpicion of a fayned death, and to ſet forth the glory of the vnwonted and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous reſurrection.</p>
               <p>Therefore in theſe wordes he decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, that his death was not after the common manner of menne, but diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſatorye: becauſe lyfe ſhoulde pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentlye followe death.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>C.</hi> And it becommeth vs at this daye ſo to thinke of the death of Chriſt,<note place="margin">Reſurrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Chriſt.</note> that therewithall we remember the glorye of the reſurrection.</p>
               <p>So we knowe that he is lyfe, becauſe hee hauing fought with death, hath mightely ouercome the ſame, and made a noble triumphe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> For by death hee hath deſtroyed him which had power of death, that is to ſaye the Deuell,<note place="margin">Heb. 2.i5.</note> and hath made them free which all their lyfe time were meere bondſlaues.</p>
               <p n="18">
                  <hi>18. No man taketh it from mee, but I laye it downe of my ſelfe: I haue power to laye it downe, and haue power to to take it agayne: this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundement haue I receyued of my Father.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>M.</hi> If ſo bée to laye downe his lyfe ſignifyeth nothing elſe but to dye, euen as to take awaye the lyfe, is to kyll: Howe then ſayth he that no man taketh away the ſame from him?

               <p>
                  <hi>C.</hi> Therefore hée doeth not onely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that men haue power in them ſelues to kyll, vnleſſe hee ſuffer them, but alſo exempteth him ſelfe from all force of neceſſitye,</p>
               <p>But it is otherwiſe with vs, who of neceſſitye are ſubiect to death by reaſon of ſinne: Chriſt alſo him ſelfe was borne a mortall man: but this was vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarye ſubmiſſion, and not violent conſtraint.</p>
               <p>This therefore pertaineth to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolacion of the Diſciples, leaſt when they ſhoulde ſée him ſhortlye after to bée carried vnto death, they might bée diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged, as though he had béene op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed of his enemies, but might know that the ſame came to paſſe by the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull prouidence of God, that he ſhould ſuffer death to redéeme the flocke.</p>
               <p>And this is alwayes a profitable doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, that therefore the death of Chriſt was a ſatiſfaction for ſinnes, becauſe it was a voluntarye ſacrifice: according to that ſaying of <hi>Paule, by the obedience of one man, many became ſinners.</hi>
               </p>
               <q>I haue power to laye it downe.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>R.</hi> This is euen the ſame which hée ſayde before, namelye, that hée therfore ſuffered, becauſe ſo it pleaſed him and the wyll of his Father, not becauſe ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Caiphas</hi> or <hi>Pilate</hi> conſtrained him.

               <p>
                  <hi>M.</hi> The reaſon here was, for that the houſe of God coulde not bée finiſhed and dedicated in the Sommer, becauſe of the wickedneſſe of the aduerſaryes, inſomuche that they were conſtrained to ende the ſame in Wynter.</p>

               <p>And veryly to the ende men may know God, it is neceſſarye that they firſt of all knowe them ſelues,<note place="margin">Galat. 4.9</note> as ſayeth the Apoſtle <hi>Paule:</hi> alſo they to whome God hath no reſpecte, muſt néedes bée alway farre from him.</p>

                  <hi>M.</hi> Whereby we gather that they can not beléeue Chriſt,<note place="margin">Titu. i.i.</note> which pertain not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Chriſt. Therfore the fayth in Chriſt, is not the Faith of Goates, of Dogges, or of Swine, but of Shéepe, that is to ſaye of the elect, as ſayeth the Apoſtle. <hi>Bv.</hi> The Reprobate haue no ſimple diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition and apte to bée taught, but a harde, variable, wanton, corrupt, and peruerſe diſpoſition, becauſe they wyll not ſuffer them ſelues to be purged and reſtored. <hi>R.</hi> They are the Sheepe of Chriſtes which heare Chriſtes voice.</p>
               <p>The Phariſeis heare not the voice of Chriſt (for they knowe his perſon, but not his worde) therefore, they neyther are his ſhéepe, neyther beléeue, nor are ſaued. <hi>C.</hi> If any man ſhould murmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringlye obiecte and ſaye, that the cauſe of vnbeléefe reſteth in God, becauſe it is in his power onely to make ſhéepe: we muſt aunſwere that hée is frée from all blame, ſéeing men by their owne volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarye wickedneſſe reiect his grace.</p>
               <p>God getteth ſo muche Fayth vnto him ſelfe as ſufficeth, but the wyld Beaſtes are neuer tame, vntyll ſuche time as by the ſpirite of God, they are turned into Shéepe.</p>
               <p>They whiche are ſuche ſhall ſéeke in vaine to laye the blame of their mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe

vppon GOD, which is proper to their owne nature.</p>
               <p>To bée ſhort Chriſt geueth vs to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtande that it is no maruaile, if ſo bee he haue fewe that imbrace his Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, becauſe ſo many as by the ſpirite of GOD are not ſubiect to the obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of Faith, are vntamed and wilde Beaſtes.</p>
               <p>Wherefore it is muche more vnméete and abſurde, that the authoritye of the Goſpell ſhoulde depend vppon the faith of menne: but rather let the faithfull waye and conſider, howe muche more they are bounde vnto GOD than they whiche are blinde, when as they them ſelues by the illumination of the ſpirite are drawne vnto Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>M.</hi> Hereby alſo we ſée that we muſt not by and by conceale the trueth before thoſe which beléeue not. For although the vnbeléeuing are vnworthy to heare the ſame, and are none of the electe: yet notwithſtanding it is ſo appoynted by God that the Goſpell of grace ſhould alſo bee preached to the Reprobate and vnbeléeuing, not becauſe there is any hope that they ſhoulde beléeue, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is ſo méete that the light of the trueth ſhoulde aboue all other thinges ſhyne before the eyes of all men, as doeth this viſible Sonne: and alſo take from them all excuſe, that the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God maye bée iuſt: by which the vnbeleeuing ſhalbe damned.</p>
               <p>Laſt of all, the Miniſters of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel haue here wherewithall to comfort them ſelues, if ſo bée their labour be not profitable to all men.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>M.</hi> Chriſt doeth not in vaine repeate the condicions of the Sheepe, and of the Paſtour. For this is a great conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation in aduerſitye, that Chriſte is our Sheaphearde, and that wée are his Shéepe.</p>

               <p>For in this place we doe heare that they onelye heare the voice of Chriſte, (that is to ſaye, doe receyue the ſame by fayth) which are ſhéepe.</p>
               <p>Nowe whereof ſhall it come that ſome are ſhéepe, that is to ſaye, capeable of the doctrine of Chriſt, and others not?</p>
               <p>No doubte becauſe the one are indued with the good ſpirite of God, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther not ſo.</p>
               <p>For the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> doeth attribute the knowledge of diuine thinges,<note place="margin">i: Cor. 2.i4</note> to ſuch as are endued with the ſpirite of God. But whereof commeth that they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with the ſpirite of God, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther not? This verilye is the cauſe, that the one are ordained to lyfe, and the other to death: that the one are geuen to the Sonne to bée ſaued, the other not ſo.</p>
               <p>Let vs geue therefore this glorye vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Lorde, that he maye geue his Spirite, without the helpe of oure workes.</p>
               <p>The whiche when hee hath deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to geue, we our ſelues maye worke therewith to inſtruct and teache: notwithſtanding, if he geue vnto them the vnderſtandinge of our worde by the ſame Spyrite, to whome wée ſpeake.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bv.</hi> Moreouer, in this place Chriſt ſpeaketh three thinges of his Shéepe.</p>
               <p>

               <p>This is the diſpoſition, theſe are the manners, and déedes of the Shéepe of Chriſt: from the which theſe vnbelee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing Iewes were moſt voide.</p>

Therefore fyrſte of al it is worthy to be noated, and remembered. For beſide that Chriſt in this miracle left vnto vs a teſtimony of his diuine power, he alſo ſette before vs an expreſſe Image, of our Reſurrection in the end of the world, to the end we might knowe the ſcope of our Faith, howe that Death is no Death, and that Chriſte is our reſurrection and life.</p>

               <p>At leaſt he doeth not arme and comfort him ſelfe with the promiſe of Chriſte, to followe him ioyfully and with a good courage.</p>
               <p>For theſe wordes <hi>Let vs alſo go that we maye dye with him,</hi> ſhewe that he rather deſpayred than beleeued, ſeeing they ſhould haue bene aſſured of life. <hi>M.</hi> The Lorde ſayde not, I goe to dye in Iury, but I goe to raiſe vp <hi>Lazarus.</hi> Thomas therefore ſhould haue ſayd, let vs go that we maye ſee the glory of God, rather then let vs goe and dye with him. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit the pronoune Relatiue (hym) maye be expounded as well of <hi>Lazarus</hi> as of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>But if we expound it of <hi>Lazarus,</hi> then is it ſpoken <hi>Ironice,</hi> as yf he had ſayde, What ſhall yt profite vs to goe thether except we cannot otherwiſe ſhewe the dutie of friendes than if wee dye with him.</p>
               <p>But many, like better of another ſence wich is, that Thomas refuſed not to dye with Chriſt. But this ſprang of raſhe zeale, becauſe he ought rather to haue bene encouraged by the faith of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe.</p>
               <p>Moreouer in that he ſaith Thomas was called <hi>Didimus</hi> is not ſo to be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoode, as though Thomas were his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per name, and Didimus his ſir name.

                  <hi>M.</hi> It beſemeth him which receiueth and entertaineth a gheſt, to vſe frendlye words in ſaluting and welcomming, that ſo he maye declare his good wil and fren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hart.</p>
               <p>So <hi>Martha</hi> here ſpeaketh vnto the Lorde and ſhe beginneth with a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>playnt: howebeit by this meanes ſhée doeth modeſtly declare her mind.

               <p>For theſe wordes, partely procéeded from Faith, but the affections of the mind were mixt therewith, which caried her yond her bonds, For in that ſhe perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded her ſelfe that her brother ſhould not haue dyed yf ſo be Chriſte had bene pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, where learneth ſhée ſo to beleeue? ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rely, it was not conceiued of any promis of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>It followeth therfore that ſhe rather ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled hir owne deſiers than obaied Chriſt It procéeded of Faith that ſhe attributed vnto Chriſts power and great godneſſe: but in that ſhe perſwadeth her ſelfe of more than ſhe had receiued or heard of Chriſt ſhe paſſeth the boundes of faith. For we muſt alwayes obſerue the mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall conſent and agréement betwéene the word and faith, leſt a man perſwade him ſelfe of any thing without the war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunt of Gods worde. Moreouer it may be that Martha leaned to much to the corporall preſence of Chriſt. Therefore the faith of <hi>Martha</hi> being mixt with im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate deſiers, and not altogether frée from ſuperſtition, could not perfectlye ſhine, only the ſparkes thereof appeare in theſe wordes.

For yf ſo be ſhée had had the true vnderſtanding of hys power ſhée would rather haue ſayde, I knowe that nothing is impoſſible vnto thée.</p>
               <p>But the Lorde was not ignoraunt of this imperfection of faith in Martha and in others, neyther did he ſeuerely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iecte the ſame: but bare patiently with it, and when he ſawe conuenient time increaſed the ſame.

               <p>
                  <hi>C.</hi> But the clemency of Chriſt is won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull who bearing with the infirmitie of <hi>Martha</hi> in thoſe thinges aforeſayd, of him ſelfe promiſed more vnto her then ſhée her ſelfe durſt openly and preciſelye aſke.</p>
               <p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Bv.</hi> Nowe Chriſt more plainelye reuealing himſelfe, ſayth that he cannot onely by his prayers obtaine lyfe, but alſo that hée is the lyfe it ſelfe of all that beléeue, yea the liuing God, which can rayſe from the deade, and preſerue in life. <hi>M.</hi> Hée knewe that <hi>Martha</hi> hadde not as yet the true knowledge of him and that therefore ſhée thought of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection as did the reſt of the Iewes who although they beléeued that the ſame ſhoulde bée, yet notwithſtanding by whoſe power the ſame ſhoulde bée, they knew not, becauſe they wanted the true knowledge of Chriſt. Wherefore that hée might ſignifie vnto <hi>Martha,</hi> that hee was the rayſer vp and quickener of deade men, by whome the reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the deade ſhoulde bée, and whiche coulde alſo at that preſent, reſtoare hir deade brother vnto life, hée ſayth, <hi>I am the reſurrection and the life: B.</hi> that is to ſaye, the authour of reſurrection, and lyfe, and that power of GOD to rayſe and to quicken. As if hee ſhoulde ſaye, Why haſt thou reſpect vnto the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection to come, concerning the which thou haſt ſuch an opinion, as though it were not to be wrought by my power? If thou kneweſt mée, thou wouldeſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo knowe that I haue power geuen mée to rayſe vp and to quicken: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore wouldeſt nowe deſyre mée to raiſe vp thy brother.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>C.</hi> Therefore fyrſt of all Chriſt affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth himſelfe to be the reſurrection and and the lyfe: and afterwarde hée ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poundeth boath partes of the ſentence ſeuerallye. In the fyrſt parte hée calleth himſelfe the reſurrection: becauſe by or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der men are reſtoared from death, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are in the ſtate of lyfe.</p>
               <p>And verilye all mankinde is ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed in death. Therefore no man ſhall haue life, but hee which is fyrſte riſen from death.</p>
               <p>So Chriſt teacheth himſelfe to be the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of life: and afterwarde hée ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth that the perpetuitie of lyfe is the works of his grace.

<q>He that beleueth on me.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Wherefore then is Chriſt the reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurection? becauſe hée doth regenerate the Children of <hi>Adam</hi> which were ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enate from GOD by ſynne, that they may beginne to leade a newe lyfe: of the which wée haue ſpoken in the fifte Chapter going before. And the Apoſtle <hi>Paule</hi> very notabelye interpreteth this place, in the ſeconde Chapter of his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle to the <hi>Epheſians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let them bable then what they liſte which affyrme that men are prepared by the motion of nature to receiue the grace of God.</p>
               <p>It is as much as yf they ſhould ſaye that the dead walke.<note place="margin">Faith is the reſurr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of the ſoule.</note> For wheras men haue lyfe, breath, ſence, vnderſtanding, and will, the ſame tendeth to deſtruction becauſe there is no part of the ſoule which is not corrupted and maymed. And ſo it commeth to paſſe that death e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerye where hath the vpper hande and kingdome.</p>
               <p>For the death of the ſoule is an aliena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from God. Therefore they which beléeue in Chriſte, whereas they were deade before, beginne to liue: becauſe Fayth is the ſpirituall Reſurrection of the ſoule, and doth after a ſorte animate the ſoule it ſelfe, that it maye liue vnto God, according to this ſaying, <hi>The dead shall heare the voyce of the ſonne of God and they that here it shall liue.</hi>

               <p>The Lord Ieſus had ſpoken two things which he orderly expoundeth. He proued him ſelfe to be the reſurrection when hée taught that life is reſtoared to the dead by faith.</p>

                  <hi>M.</hi> The Euangeliſt in ſaying, that <hi>Mary</hi> fell downe at the féete of Chriſt, expreſſeth the ſinguler affection of loue and reuerence, which ſhée bare towards him. <hi>R.</hi> Shée is not afeard of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the Iewes, whome ſhée knewe, not to be very gratious vnto the Lorde, neither dyd ſhée regard their friendſhip, which they declared in comming to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort her, nor yet doeth ſhée feare their iudgement: but as ſhée bare a louing and reuerent heart toward the Lord, ſo ſhée ſhewed her ſelfe in the ſight of all men without deſemulation. <hi>C.</hi> And herby we gather that the Lorde was worſhipped and ſerued in that houſe: far ſuppaſſing the common manner of men.</p>

For he ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that there is no cauſe why they ſhould bee diſcoraged, becauſe the doctrine of the Goſpell ſhalbe publiſhed neuertheleſſe throughout the whole world. And leaſt this cogitacion of his glory might ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye after vaniſhe away, when he ſhould be iudged to dye, hanged on the Croſſe, &amp; buryed, he ſheweth that the ignominy of his death ſhould nothing at all hinder his glorye.</p>

And although this admonicion was moſt neceſſarye at that inſtant, yet notwithſtanding it hath a continuall vſe in the Church. And firſt of all it is méete to beginne at the head.

And ſo it ſhall nothing hinder but that his glory ſhal apeare and ſhine. From hence alſo we muſt come to the members. For we do not only think that we do periſhe in death,<note place="margin">Colloſ 3, 3</note> but we doe alſo thinke that our life is like vnto con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall death. Therefore we ſhalbe vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly quayled, except we haue this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation by which Paule doeth erect vs,<note place="margin">2. Cor 4, i6</note>

               <p>
                  <hi>B.</hi> Therefore that which Chriſt ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth here hath this ſcence and meaning: Ye haue ſéene with howe greate pompe the people of the Iewes haue receyued me: nowe alſo ye ſée howe theſe forrey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners deſyre mée: therefore learne ye to ſéeke for life and ſaluation by death.</p>

                  <hi>M.</hi> In this place wée haue an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe example of a troubled minde, and that in him whiche coulde not bée cape<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able of ſo great perturbation, if hée had woulde.</p>
               <p>A troubled minde doeth many wayes diſpute with it ſelfe, one while in cly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to this, another to that, vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine what to ſaye or doe. <hi>C.</hi> Here therefore as before our eyes we doe ſée, how much our ſaluation coſt the Sonne of GOD, who being brought into ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame trouble, as he was man, knew neyther in wordes nor by counſayle, howe to expreſſe the vehemencye of his gréefe, and therefore his laſt refuge was to fall to prayer, wherein hée deſyreth to be deliuered from death.</p>
               <p>Moreouer becauſe he ſawe him ſelfe to bée appointed by the eternall purpoſe of GOD, to bée a Sacrifice for ſinnes, hee by and by correcteth that Prayer whiche hée made in great ſorrowe and trouble of minde, that he might whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye ſubmitte him ſelfe vnto the wyll of his Father.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>R.</hi> Therefore the ſpirite prayeth and the fleſhe prayeth: but the ſpirite ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commeth the fleſhe. For the wyll of Chriſte was nothing contrarye to the wyll of his Father: but looke what the Father willed, the Sonne willed the ſame. Therefore, when he prayeth to bée deliuered from death, it is neyther properlye the voyce of the Diuinitye, nor of the humanitye, but of a volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary emptying and abaſing of himſelfe, by whiche Chriſt tooke vppon him the affections of nature, ſinne excepted.</p>
               <p>The fleſhe prayeth to bée delyuered from the Croſſe, and cannot wyſhe the ſame: but the ſpirite correcteth and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer commeth the ſame, ſaying:
<q>But therefore came I into this worlde:</q>
to ſuffer, to dye, and to bée Crucified.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>C.</hi> Wherefore in this place wée muſt noate fiue degrées.</p>
               <p>The firſt place containeth a complaint, which burſteth foorth of excéeding gréefe and ſorrow: ſecondly, he feeleth him ſelfe to be paſt al remedy, and leaſt he ſhould
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:14631:224"/>
be ouerwhelmed with feare he demaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth of him ſelfe what he ſhould ſaye: thirdly he fléeeth vnto the Father, and deſireth hym to be his deliueret: fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye he detracteth his prayer whiche he knewe was againſte his callynge, and wiſheth to ſuffer any thinge rather than he ſhould not fulfill that which was enioyned to him of his Father: laſtly he beinge contented with the glory of God onely, he forgetteth all other things, and counteth them as nothing.</p>
               <p>But this ſeemeth to be vnméete for the ſon of God, that he ſhould vnaduiſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly make his prayer, the whiche he muſte by and by renounce to obay his Father.</p>
               <p>We confeſſe verelye that this is the fooliſhneſſe of the Croſſe, whiche is a ſtumbling blocke of offence.<note place="margin">Affections in Chriſte vvere pure.</note>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Is it is ſayd in the firſte Chapter of the fyrſt Epiſtle to the <hi>Corinthians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the more the Lord abaced himſelfe, the more his vnſpeakable loue towards vs is manifeſted.</p>
               <p>Moreouer we muſt remember what was ſpoken of before, that the humaine affections from the which he was not fre were pure in hym, and voyde of Sinne: the reaſon is, becauſe they were framed and tempered to the obdience of God.</p>
               <p>For there is no let, but y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Chriſte ſhould feare naturally death, and yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandinge deſire to obay God: but in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers reſpectes</p>
               <p>Herevpon came the correction, when he ſayeth, that therefore he came into this howre. For how ſoeuer he feared death, notwithſtanding becauſe he waied wher<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore he was ſent, and what the office of a redeemer required, he offereth the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror conceiued of the ſence of nature, to his father to be corrected, or rather that the ſame beinge reſtrayned, he might make him ſelfe frée and at libertye to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute the commaundement of God.</p>
               <p>Wherefore if ſo be the affections of Chriſt whiche were pure from al ſinne, ought ſo to be reſtrayned that he might be obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to his Father:<note place="margin">Affections in man ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to God</note> how diligently ought we to ſéeke to ſuppreſſe our affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, ſéeing there is not one of them but they are enemies vnto God.</p>
               <p>Let this therefore be the meditation of the godly, to ſtriue againſt them ſelues vntyll they haue denyes themſelues. We muſt alſo noate howe that not only thoſe affections are to be brideled which are contrary to the will of God, but alſo which do hinder the courſe of our calling although otherwiſe they are neyther hurtfull nor vitiouſe. To the ende thys maye more euidently appeare, we muſt place the will of God in the firſt degrée? in the ſecond degree, the pure and ſincere will of man as the ſame was geuen of God to <hi>Adam,</hi> and as the ſame was in Chriſt: In the laſt degrée, our will which is infected by the contagion of ſin. The wil of God is a Rule to the which what<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſoeuer is inferiour to the ſame muſt bée ſubiect. Now the pure wil of nature ſhal not of it ſelfe be rebelliouſe vnto God: howebeit man hath many impediments though he be framed and bent neuerſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much to the right way, vnleſſe he ſubdue hys affections vnto God, Chriſt therfore had one ſimple battaile, that he might feare no more that thing, which natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally he feared, when he knewe other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe to pleaſe God: but we haue a double battaile, becauſe we muſte fight againſt the ſtubbornneſſe of our fleſhe.</p>
               <p>Herevppon it commeth to paſſe that the moſt valiaunt ſouldiers do neuer get the victory without a wound, Wee muſt alſo learne to obſerue this order, that ſo often as we are vexed with feare, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed with ſorrowe, we by and by lift vp our hartes vnto God. There is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing worſe or more hurtful than to foſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that within vs which doeth vexe vs. And this is the iuſt puniſhment of ſlouth and negligence in all thoſe, which will not come vnto God.</p>

               <p>To haue the name of God gloryfied, is to haue God the Father hym ſelfe in many places preached and acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged.

Or to ſpeake more large, he glorified it when Chriſt was borne of a virgine, when he wrought miracles, when he was worſhipped of the <hi>Magi</hi> guided by a Starre, when he was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knoweledged of the ſaints ful of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt when he was reuealed by the deſcending of the holy ghoſt in the like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of a <hi>Doue,</hi> when he was declared by a voyce ſounding from heauen, when: hee was tranſfigured on the mountain.

               <p>By this word arme it is euident inough that hée vnderſtandeth the power of God.

               <p>To caſt out Deuelles was a worke of the finger of God, but the wicked at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed the ſame vnto Sathan. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore?

Neyther dyd God looke downe &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſider from heauen, what men woulde doe, but he pronounceth what he him ſelfe woulde doe: namelye, that he woulde ſtryke the wicked with blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe &amp; giddines, that he might take ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance vpon their wickedneſſe. For here the inferiour cauſe is noated why God woulde haue his word, which by nature is whoalſome, to bée perillous and dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye to the Iewes: namelye, for that they had ſo deſerued by their wickedneſſe.</p>
               <p>It was impoſſible for them to ſhonne this puniſhment, when God had once determined to caſte them into a repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate ſcence, and to turne the light of his worde into darkeneſſe.</p>
               <p>For this latter Propheſye is vnlyke to the firſt in this, becauſe there the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phete affirmeth that no other do beléeue than thoſe whome God doeth illuminate according to his good pleaſure, the cauſe whereof doeth not appeare.</p>
               <p>For ſéeing of right and equity all men are loſt and dampned, God maye ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his goodneſſe ſaue whome he wyll from among the reſt.</p>

               <p>Wherefore we muſte remember this definition, namelye that Chriſte is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected, when we imbrace not the pure doctrine of the Goſpoll. <hi>M.</hi> euen as to receiue Chriſte is nothing elſe, but to receyue his worde by a liuely faithe.</p>

               <p>This is the teſtimony of the trueth, and of the will of God towardes man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.

                  <hi>C.</hi> This is a ſpeach worthy to be noa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for it is referred to the knoweledge of Chriſt, that he knewe his death to bée a paſſage vnto the heauenlye kingdome of God.</p>
               <p>Wherefore, yf hée making haſt thy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did not let to loue hys Diſciples as he was wont, there is no cauſe now why wée ſhould think that his affection is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered.</p>
               <p>And nowe ſéeing hée is the firſte bée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten among the dead: this difinition of death pertayneth to the whoale body of the Church becauſe it is a paſſage vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God, from the which the faythfull are as yet pilgrimes. <hi>M.</hi> Therefore let vs ſo think and ſpeak of our death,<note place="margin">2.

               <p>It maketh very much to the purpoſe that he vſeth this word father.

               <p>The wordes are that Chriſt had loued hys Diſciples, whiche weare in the worlde.</p>
               <p>Wherefore although we ſeeme to bee farre of from Chriſte, yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding let vs knowe that hee behoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth vs: becauſe hee loueth his that are in the worlde.</p>

                  <hi>M.</hi> But the Originall roote and cauſe, is in Chriſte him ſelfe and not in his Diſciples. If ſo be the cauſe of this loue had bene in the Diſciples, it had not continued to the ende.

               <p>For the Lorde dyd not this to appoint among his Apoſtles any ſuperiority, but rather to draw away their mindes from ambition, and the deſyre of Lordſhip. This cannot bée tenyed.

               <p>This modeſtye were to be commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, if ſo be obedience were not more acceptable vnto God than any ſeruice or ſacrifice beſide: yea, if ſo be this were not the true and onelye rule of humily<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tye, to ſubmit our ſelues vnto the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of God, and to haue all our ſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces tyed vnto his wyll: that we might allow &amp; lyke without controuerſy, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer he affirmeth to be pleaſant vnto him. Therefore the true waye to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippe God is, to ſubſcribe and agrée to all that God commaundeth.</p>

               <p>For the Religion of ſuperſticion is commonlye prepoſterous: In ſinning it is moued with no reuerence towards GOD: but in praying for remiſſion of ſinnes, wée wyll ſéeme to ſhewe reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence towardes God, confeſſing, but yet ſuperſticiouſlye, (I wyll not ſaye wickedlye) that wée are ſo vnworthye that we ſhoulde not preſume to come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the preſence of God, to craue helpe at his handes.</p>
               <p>And, as it is true, that we are vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to come into the preſence of GOD, ſo it is Godlye to confeſſe our vnworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.

For whome thinketh mortall man him ſelfe to be, yf he refuſe to beare the burthen of his bretheren, to apply him ſelfe to the manners of others and to doe thoſe duties by which the vnitie of the Church is maintayned? The ſumme is this that the ſame man doth arrogate to muche vnto him ſelfe who conſidereth not that he doth therefore liue among his weake bretheren willingly to doe thoſe duties which ſeeme vncomelye. <hi>B.</hi> For Chriſte doeth not only require the waſhing of the féete, but alſo all the duties of true due.</p>
               <p>For it is a figure called <hi>Sinecdoche,</hi> by which we muſt vnderſtand by that which is moſt ſeruile, all other duties.

                  <hi>B.</hi> The Biſhoppe of Roome too apiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly followeth Chriſt in many thinges: and in this he would ſéeme to followe Chriſt waſhing once in a yeare the féete of ſertaine poore folke which haue béene waſhed before and not only waſhed but alſo perfumed with ſwéete odours and waters.</p>
               <p>And thus by a bare and naked Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony they thinke that they haue done very well and when they haue done it, they can be contented to contemne their brethren, and cruelly to teare the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Chriſt and to ſpitte in his face.

And hée doth not only animate them to perſiſte in their vocation, notwithſtanding the fall of Iudas but alſo becauſe the felicity of the which he ſpake pertained not to all men he teacheth that the ſame ought to be the more earneſtly ſought for of all men, and when they haue founde it with the greater conſtancie to abide in the ſame.</p>
               <p>And now this their ſtedfaſt ſtanding he attributeth to their election.

               <p>For ſome thinke that the propheſye is cited which properly belongeth vnto Chriſt, otherſome think it to be a ſimple compariſon that like as Dauid was wickedly betrayed of his domiſticall e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemie, euen ſo the like condition abideth for the Childeren of God. After theſe mens opinions this is the ſence. In that one of my diſciples is a wicked traytor, it is no newe or vnwonted thing in the worlde but rather that is put in practiſe at this daye whiche the Scripture teſtifieth to be done longe agoe.</p>
               <p>But ſéeing the ſame was ſhadowed in Dauid, which was more fully after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to be ſeene in Chriſt, their Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſéemeth better which affirme the ſame properly to be fulfilled, whiche Dauid had forſhewed by the ſpirite of propheſy.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>M.</hi> Thus therefore he ſéemeth to ſhew a reaſon wherefore he choſe Iudas, for that he was not ignorant what he was, leaſt that which ſhoulde come to paſſe might ſeeme to happen vnawares vnto him.</p>
               <p>Moreouer to lift vp the héele meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorically ſignifieth vnder the cooller of frendſhippe to ſet vppon one by deceite that he maye bée oppreſſed vnawares. Nowe that which Chriſt ſuffered béeing our head and example, we muſt alſo pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently ſuffer béeing his members. <hi>M.</hi> In this place alſo the authority of the Scripture is commended becauſe all thinges in the ſame are neceſſarily ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled.</p>
               <p>Wherefore we muſt take héede that we do not doubt of the fulfilling of them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the holy Ghoſt, whatſoeuer he doth in the Scriptures whether it be by tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching or reprehending by threatning or promiſing by terrifiyng or comfortyng cannot lye.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> For as Chriſt ſayeth, the ſcripture cannot but bee fulfilled:<note place="margin">Ioh. 10.35. Eſay. 40.8</note> becauſe the word of the Lorde abydeth for euer.</p>
               <p n="11">

                  <hi>11. Nowe I tell you bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it come, that when it is come to paſſe yee might beeleue that I am hee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>C.</hi> By this ſentence he admoniſheth his Diſciples that there is ſo litle cauſe why they ſhould ſtomble or fall becauſe a traytor ſhall come out of their company, that they ought rather thereby to be the better confirmed in faith: For excepte we did behould with our eyes the verye ſame in the Church which was forſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed concerning the troubles and conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the ſame we might haue Iuſte occaſion to doubt of propheſyes. But ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the trueth of the Scripture doth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grée with our experience, then we haue better intelligence that God hath a care for vs and that we are gouerned by hys prouidence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>M.</hi> Therefore let vs noat to what ende Chriſt went aboute to confirme the mindes of his Apoſtles in the fayth towardes hym. They had ſéene manye of his miracles, and of late when hée rayſed vp Lazarus oute of the graue (when he had béene dead fowre dayes) they ſtoode by and yet notwithſtanding it was ſo great a matter to beleeue in him, that they had alſo néede to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted and confirmed in that faith by the Scriptures of the Prophetes. <hi>C.</hi> Moreouer by theſe wordes.</p>
               <q>That yee might beleeue that J am hee.</q>
               <p>He geueth vs to vnderſtand that hée is the ſame meſſias which was promiſed. Not that the treaſon of Iudas, beganne to bring the Diſciples vnto the Fayth (for they knewe him already, and had confeſſed who he was) but becauſe their faith profited more,<note place="margin">Iohn. 6.69</note> when they came vnto the experience of thoſe thinges, which they had heard before out of the mouth of Chriſt. And nowe we maye two wayes vnderſtand the ſame as, that he ſayeth that the Diſciples ſhall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue when they ſee the matter come to paſſe becauſe nothing was hidden from him or elſe that none of thoſ- things ſhould faile him which the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture teſtifieth concerning Chriſt. Both theſe ſentences maye ſerue well.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>B,</hi> Therefore when they ſawe that he knewe all thinges before they came to paſſe and yet notwithſtanding woulde willingly ſuffer the ſame they mighte eaſily know that he was very Chriſte and God.</p>
               <p>Howbéeit they did better way and vnderſtand theſe thinges, when they were more amply endued with the holy Ghoſt, Concerning the expoſition of the twenty verſe, reade in our commentary vppon the tenth Chapter of Mathewe beginning at the forty verſe.</p>

So great was the plague of couetouſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and ſuch liberty he had to abuſe the knowen libertie of the Lorde.

Alſo this place teacheth that the wicked ought to be ſo handeled that they be not at the firſte poynted out with the finger, vntill ſuch time as God doth manifeſt them with his hand.

                  <hi>C.</hi> Why he calleth this a newe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement, there are diuers opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Some thinke this to bée the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that forſomuch as all that was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed in the Law concerning loue, was lyteral and externall, Chriſt writ the ſame in the heartes of the faythfull by his holye ſpirite. And ſo in their opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Lawe is newe, which he ſetteth forth after a newe faſhion: that it might haue his full ſtrength.</p>
               <p>But this ſeemeth to be far fetchte, and contrarye to the purpoſe of Chriſt. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſome expounde it to be called a new commaundement becauſe although the Lawe doeth commaunde loue, yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witſtanding, becauſe it is mixed with many Ceremonies, and circumſtaunces, depending vppon the ſame, the doctrine of loue, doeth not there ſo euidently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare: and contrarywiſe, in the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, the perfection of loue is appointed without any ſhaddowes.</p>
               <p>This interpretacion is not to be deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyſed. Howbeit Chriſt ſéemed to ſpeake now ſimply. For we know that Lawes in the beginning are kept diligently, but are by lytle and lytle forgotten againe, tyl at the leangth they growe out of vſe. Therefore Chriſt, the better to imprint the doctrine of loue in the mindes of his diſciples, commendeth the ſame of new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. As if he ſhould ſay, I would haue you alwayes to remember this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement, euen as if it were a Law newlye made. To bée ſhort, we ſée that the purpoſe of Chriſt in this place was to exhort his Diſciples vnto loue, leaſt at any time they ſhould ſuffer them ſelues to be drawen from the loue of the ſame, or ſuffer the doctrine thereof to go out of their mindes.

                  <hi>Bv.</hi> The Diſciples being much grée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, marked not what the Lorde ſayde vnto them, and iudging to groſlye of the wordes of the Lorde, vnderſtande not his minde and purpoſe. <hi>C.</hi> And although at the firſt ſight, the aunſwere of <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi> ſéemeth to diſagrée with the ſaying of Chriſt, yet notwithſtanding his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe was not to diſcréedite his Maiſter.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding it may be demaunded howe he denied that which the Lord had affirmed. We aunſwere, that there are oftentimes in the Saintes confuſed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandinges: becauſe they doe not way and conſider the manner and reaſon of that which is plainlye ſet before them. So the calling of the Gentiles was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſied by the Prophetes to come of the true ſcence of Faith:<note place="margin">Ephe. 3, 9</note> the which notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the Apoſtle <hi>Paule</hi> affirmeth to bée a miſterye hydden from them.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>R.</hi> This is the principall poynt and ſum of the whole Goſpell, that Chriſt is the waye, the trueth, and the lyfe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>C.</hi> Chriſt doeth not dyrectlye aunſwere vnto the queſtion: yet notwithſtanding he omitteth nothing which is necearye to bée knewne. The curioſitye of <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi> was to bée bridled: therefore Chriſt doth not ſhewe what his condicion ſhal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be with the Father: but ſtandeth vppon a more neceſſery point. <hi>Thomas</hi> would wyllinglye haue hearde what Chriſte ſhould doe in heauen: euen as we often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times doe to muche wearye our ſelues with ſuch ſubtile and curious poyntes.</p>
               <p>But wee ought rather to applye our mindes, how we ſhalbe partakers of the bleſſed reſurrection to come. Wherfore the ſum of this ſentence is, that whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer getteth Chriſt, ſhell want nothing, and that therefore he goeth beyonde all perfection, which is not contented with him alone. And he ſpeaketh of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grées, as if he ſhould ſaye, that he is the beginning, the middeſt, and the ende.</p>
               <p>Wherevppon it followeth that we muſt begin with him, goe forewarde in him, and ende at him. We muſt not ſéeke for higher wiſdome than that which leadeth vs to euerlaſting lyfe. This he affirmeth ſhalbe founde in him. And hée alſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounceth that the ſame muſt bee ſought for in no other.

<pb n="482" facs="tcp:14631:246"/>
reacheth out his hande to thoſe that goe aſtray, and doeth humble himſelfe ſo far, that he directeth ſucking Children: hee hauing profeſſed him ſelfe to bée a Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, forſooke not his ſeruauntes in the midſt of their race, but made them par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of the trueth.

Trueth in this place is taken of ſome to bée the wholſome lyght of heauenly wiſedome.

Euen as when it is ſayde, <hi>Grace and trueth came by Chriſt Ieſus.</hi> But more rightlye it is taken for the perfection of Faith,<note place="margin">Iohn. 1.7</note> euen as the waye is taken for the beginning and firſt rudiments. This is the ſum, That if any decline from Chriſt, he can doe nothing but erre: if ſo bée any reſt not in him, he ſhal finde notſting but wynde and vanitye: if ſo be any goe beyonde him, he ſhall finde death in ſteede of lyfe. <hi>B.</hi> Therefore Chriſt in this place preacheth him ſelfe to bee God and the onelye ſauiour: euen as he hath done in other places when he called him ſelfe, the bread of lyfe, the lyght of the worlde, the doore, and the ſhéepfould of God, the good Sheepheard, the reſurrection and the lyfe, and ſuche lyke.</p>
               <q>No man commeth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Father.</q>
               <p>This is an expoſition of that whiche went before: For, he is therefore the waye, becauſe hée leadeth vs vnto the Father, and the trueth and the lyfe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in him we beholde the Father.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>R.</hi> All other thinges do diſcourage vs that we dare not appeare vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> father.

                  <hi>R.</hi> For no man hath ſéene God at any tyme, the only begotten ſonne which is in the boſome of the father hath declared hym.</p>

               <p>But he is ſayd to be the expreſſe Image of God: becauſe God hath wholy reuea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led himſelfe in hym, by his exceeding goodneſſe, wiſedome, and power.</p>

                  <hi>C.</hi> But this is the ſimple meanyng of Chriſt, that his power was ſo little tyed to that preſence of his bodye, by whiche he proued him ſelfe to be the ſon of God, that the ſame ſhould be ſet forth by more and greater experimentes, he being ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent. For ſtraight after the aſſention of Chriſt, followed the wonderfull conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the world, in whiche the diuinitie of Chriſt more mightely declared it ſelfe than whan he liued among men. Thus we ſee that the approbation of the diuini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tye of Chriſte was not ſhutte vp in his parſon, but ſpread throughoute the whole body of the Churche.

               <p>The reaſon why the Apoſtles ſhould do greater Myracles than Chriſt him ſelfe is, becauſe he goyng to take poſſeſion of his kingdome, woulde more fully ſhewe foorth his power from heauen.</p>
               <p>Whereby it appeareth that nothyng of his glory was deminiſhed, in that his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles wrought more excelentlye after his departure who were onely his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumentes Yea,<note place="margin">Philip. 2.</note> hereby it appeareth that he ſitteth at the right hand of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that euery knée might bowe before hym. <hi>R.</hi> For to go vnto the father in this place, is for Chriſt being now not only God, but alſo man, by his death and reſurrection to enter into the kingdome of his father, to ſit at his right hand, and to take vppo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him the rule of all cretures.

That he might correct this vice, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundeth them to bend their loue ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way, namely, to the obſeruing of thoſe commaundementes which he had geuen them.</p>

For at the firſt he founde all alyke, that is to ſaye, quite gone aſtraye from him. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he can chooſe none which loue him:
<pb n="494" facs="tcp:14631:252" rendition="simple:additions"/>
but the chooſeth ſome out from among his enemies, whoſe heartes he maye bende to loue him: but he thought it not good at this tyme, to touch that difference which was farre from the purpoſe. His pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe was to exhorte his Diſciples to the earneſt deſyre of Godlyneſſe, that they might profit more and more in the faith. Therefore he thought it ſufficient, to put a difference betwéene his Diſciples and the world, by this noate, that they ſhould obſerue and kéepe the doctrine of the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel. And that this noate belongeth vnto the beginning of faith, becauſe it is the effect of calling. And Chriſt ſheweth by theſe wordes how we ſhall rightly obaye the Goſpell, namelye, for when our du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyes, and externall actions, doe ſpring from the loue of the ſame. For our armes, and force, and our whole body al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo laboureth in vaine, except the loue of God doe raigne in our heart, which go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerneth the externall members.</p>
               <p>Nowe ſéeing it is ſertayne that we kepe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſayings of Chriſt, yf ſo be we loue him, and contrarywiſe we loue him, yf wée kéepe his commaundementes, it follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth, that we ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not finde in the whoale world the true and perfect loue of hym becauſe there is no man which perfectly keepeth hys commaundementes.

               <q>And my father wil loue him.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>R.</hi> In this place we haue the greate and wonderfull benifits of God, whiche procéede from the fruites of the Goſpell. The fyrſte is, that God the Father lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth the faithfull, Nowe if God be with vs,<note place="margin">Rom, 8, 3i,</note> who can be againſt vs? If the Lorde loue me I will not care what man, or Sathan can do vnto me. The ſecond is that boath the Sonne and the Father, will dwell with him that beléeueth the word of God.</p>
               <p>Than the which benifits what grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter can be deuiſed. For the Father &amp; the ſonne are very bountifull and benificial ghueſtes: they, came not empty handed neyther doe they go awaye without ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luting their hoaſt: but as they bringe with them the treaſure of all goodneſſe, euenſo they leaue behynde them the bleſſing of all goodneſſe.</p>

And he mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth not that firſte illumination, but thoſe degrées of faith, by whiche the faithfull muſt goe forward dayly, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to this ſaying, <hi>to him that hath shalbe geuen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore the Papiſtes doe draw amis from this place two ſortes of loue, with the which we loue God. They imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine that we loue God naturally, before he doeth regenerate vs with his ſpirite, by whiche aptneſſe and readineſſe (ſaye they) we deſerue the grace of regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. As though the Scriptures dyd not teache, and experience plainlye proue, that we are quite tourned awaye from God, and are haters of him, vntyll ſuche tyme as he chaunge our hearts. Wée muſt remember the purpoſe of Chriſt, that he and his Father wyl come to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme the faythfull in the euerlaſting aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuraunce of grace, in ſuch wyſe that they maye feele the grace of God to reſt vpon them, and maye be dayly increaſed more and more with the gyftes of God.</p>

                  <hi>C.</hi> Becauſe the faythfull are mixed in this worlde with vnbeleuers, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of neceſſitye they muſt be troubled as it were in the toſſing and raginge waues of theſea: Chriſt againe confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth them by this admonition, leſt they ſhoulde be drawen awaye by euell ex<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>amples. As if he ſhould ſaye, Haue no regard vnto the worlde, neither depend vpon the ſame: becauſe their ſhall be all wayes ſome, which ſhall contemne me and my doctrine: but conſtantly retayne ye to the ende, that grace which ye haue allwaye imbraced. And herewithall he declareth that the worlde doth ſuffer Iuſte pooniſhment for his ingratitude, when it periſheth in his blindenes, when by the contempte of true righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſſnes, it bewrayeth his wicked hatred againſt Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>B.</hi> To kepe the ſayinges of Chriſt is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe, but to beleue that the ſame is true and wholſome, and alſo to cleue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſame with our whole harte: euen as we may gather by the Scripture, <hi>Heare O Iſrall the ordinaunces and the Lawes which I propoſe to you this daye, that ye maye learne them, and take hede to obſerue them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yf by keping the commaundementes of God, ye vnderſtand the fulfilling of them, no man ſhall kepe them: but if ye vnderſtand it for ſeeking to fulfill them, then all the godly kepe them. For he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not chooſe but geue him ſelfe to the kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of the commaundementes of God, which truely knoweth the ſame to be of God. <hi>A.</hi> Contrarywiſe, not to kepe the Lords ſayings, is to reiecte the doctrine of Chriſt, and to contemne his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundementes: which all the wycked are wonte to doe.</p>
               <q>And the word which ye heare is not mine. <hi>C.</hi>

               <p>Leſte the diſciples ſhould fall or ſlide a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waye, for the obſtinat wickednes of the worlde, Chriſt ſeketh againe to confirme his doctrine, when he teſtifieth the ſame to be of God, and not deuiſed in earth by man. And in this conſiſteth the ſtedfaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of our Faith, yf ſo be we know God to be our guide, and are grounded vppon nothing elſe but vppon his eternall truth</p>
               <p>Therefore howe much ſoeuer the worlde doth rage in his madnes, let vs followe the doctrine of Chriſt, which far ſurmounteth heauen and earth. In de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiding the worlde to be his, he frameth him ſelfe to his diſciples: as if he ſhoulde ſaye that the ſame was not of men, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he faythfully deliuered that which was committed to him of his Father.</p>
               <p>Neuertheles let vs knowe, that for ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as he is the euerlaſting wiſdome of God, he is the onely well ſpring of doctrine, and that they haue ſpoken by his ſpirite which haue bene Prophetes from the beginning.</p>

                  <pb n="496" facs="tcp:14631:253"/>The Lord knew well ynough how rude and ignoraunt his Diſciples were, and that they were not capeable of thoſe thinges which he ſpake: the which they ſuff cie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly declared by queſtioning with hym, as we haue heard, firſt in <hi>Thomas,</hi> ſecondly in <hi>Phillip,</hi> and thirdly in <hi>Iudas.</hi> For this cauſe leſſe they ſhoulde be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged, he promyſed vnto them nowe the ſecond time the holy Ghoſt, the ſpirit of truthe, which ſhoulde be vnto them a continuall teacher, and which ſhoulde a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byde with them in their mindes, and ſhould teach &amp; tel them all thoſe things, which they had ſo often tymes all ready heard but not playnly inough for them to vnderſtand, partly becauſe of their rude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and partlye by reaſon of the ſorrow of their hartes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>C.</hi> The Lorde at that time ſowed the ſeede of doctrine, which for a time laye as it were choaked in his Diſciples. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he exhorteth them to hope wel vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till ſuch time as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> doctrine brought fruit whiche as yet might ſeme vnprofitable. In fine he affirmeth vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull matter of conſolation was in that doctrine whiche they had heard. The whiche although it dyd not by and by ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare vnto them yet neuertheleſſe he wylleth them to be of good cheare, vntill the Spirite the internall Scoolemaſter, ſpake the ſame in their harts.

               <p>This pooniſhment Eſay threateneth to the vnbeleuing, that the worde of God ſhould be vnto them as a ſhut booke: but the Lorde doth after this manner often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times humble his ſeruaunts.

               <p>
                  <hi>R.</hi> Fyrſt of all we learne by this place, that the holy Ghoſt is geuen to the Church of God the Father through the Mediatour Chriſt, who hath purchaſſed the ſame of the Father that wée might be the ſonnes of God by adoption.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>C.</hi> Secondly we learne that the external preaching of the Goſpel ſhal be to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, excepte the derection of the ſpirite be Ioyned therewith. Therefore God vſeth to teach by two maner of wayes, namely by the outward ſounde of his worde proceding out of mens mouthes and by the inwarde operation of his holy ſpirit: and this be doth at diuers times according to his goodwil and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. <hi>T.</hi> Example here of we haue in the- Actes of the Apoſtells, of whome Saynt Luke wrighteth thus: <hi>VVhoſe hart the Lorde opened ſo that he gaue dillygent heede vnto thoſe thinges whiche Paull preached. M.</hi> For we ſhall be alwaye taught in vaine, withoute the Spirite of God be our teacher: &amp; except he teach in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly in the hart, al doctrine is in effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall, yea although Chriſt ſhould preache the ſame with his owne mouth.</p>
               <p>Moreouer we are taught that the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of the Apoſtles is not of men, but procéeding from the Spirite of GOD. For what other thing did they teache than that ſame which they had receyued from the holye Ghoſt? <hi>R.</hi> This place is wonderfully conſtrued by the wicked. For they ſaye, that Chriſt taught not all thinges, but reſerued many thinges for his Apoſtles to be reuealed by the holye Ghoſt: of the which number they Iudge thoſe wicked ceremonies of the Maſſe to bée. But what doth Chriſt ſpeake here? <hi>C.</hi> What are all thoſe thinges, the teacher whereof hée promiſeth that the Spirite ſhall be? <hi>Hee shall (ſayth hee) teach you al things, and bring all thinges into your remembrance what ye shal do.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Wherevpon it followeth, that there ſhall no newe reuelations. In theſe fewe wordes all thoſe things are confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted which Sathan hath brought into the church, vnder y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> pretence of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> holy ghoſt. The <hi>Mahumetes</hi> and the Pope haue all one beginning of religion: they boath affirming that the perfection of doctrine is not contained in the ſcripture but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>céedeth

from the reuelation of the ſpirite. With theſe alſo agrée the Anabaptiſts and the Libertines. But they are ledde by a ſeduſing Spirite, and not by the ſpirite of Chriſt, who thruſte in ſtraung Doctrine contrarye to the Goſpell. For Chriſt promiſeth the holye Ghoſt, which ſhoulde as aſubſcriber confirme the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of the Goſpell. <hi>M.</hi> For the holye Ghoſt deliuered no other doctrine to the Apoſtles, than the very ſame which they had hearde before, out of the mouthe of Chriſt. Let vs therefore take héede of thoſe which boaſte of the reuelations of the holy Ghoſt, if ſo be they offer vnto vs ſtraunge Doctrine, contrarye to that which wée haue receyued of Chriſt.</p>

               <p>Like vnto this is that place of Paule where he ſaith, That Chriſt hath deliue<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>red vp his kingdome to God the Father that God might be all in all.

               <p>Surely thus, becauſe the Diuinitye, which we maye nowe behoulde only in the face of Chriſt, ſhall then bée openly ſene in it ſelfe.

               <p>Wée muſte alſo noate thot the ſame is attributed here to the deuell, which is done by wicked men.

the Diſciples to knowe that hee was not obnoxius to infirmytye, leſte they ſhould think to baſely of his power But in this generall ſentence that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ſentence is concluded, that in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duing death he was not bounde to Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than.

                  </hi> Otherſome alſo noat here, that Sathan had no power in Chriſt, becauſe the members and inſtrumentes of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than could not obtayne that whiche they deſired.

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Sathan had no pow<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>er in Chriſt</note>Therefore the power of ſathan could preuaile nothing againſte the Lorde of light and lyfe. This is no ſmall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation to the faithfull, For the Lorde Ieſus hath ouer come for vs, ſin, death, and ſathan. Wherfore if ſathan had no power in the head, neither ſhall he haue any power in the members. For the victory, life, and innocencye of Chriſt Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus is ours by Faith.</p>
               <p>Therefore yf at the hower of death the Prince of this world, come vnto thée, be not afrayde: conſider that he hath bente and vſed all his force againſte the Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, and preuailed not, but was ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwne him ſelfe, when he thought to haue gotten the victory.</p>
               <p>The Lorde Ieſus got the victory for thy ſake, and thou ſhalte ouercome in hym. <hi>R.</hi> But if Sathan had no power ouer Chriſt, why then did he preuail ſo muche that he brought him to the death of the Croſſe?

               <p>But it is néedefull to diſcuſſe euerye propertie of the Vine, but onely ſumma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily to conſider to what ende Chriſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plieth this ſimilitude.</p>
               <p>Therefore there are thrée ſpeciall partes: The firſt is, That we haue no ſtrength of our ſelues to doe good but from him: the ſeconde, That we hauing roote in him, are purged and garniſhed by the father: the third is, that he cutteth of the vnfruitfull braunches, that they mighte be caſt into the fyer and burnte.

<pb n="500" facs="tcp:14631:256"/>
that whatſoeuer good thing they haue it commeth from God: but afterwarde they fayne that they haue a vniuerſall grace geuen vnto them, as though it were naturally ingraffed in them. But Chriſt ſpecialy ſtandeth vpon this poynt that vitall Moyſture doeth ſpring from him aloane: wherevppon it followeth that mans nature is vnfruitfull and voyde of all goodneſſe: becauſe no man knoweth the nature of the vine vntill he be ingrafted in the ſame. But this is geuen by ſpetial grace to the elect alone. The firſte authoure therefore of all good thinges is the father who planteth vs by his hand: but the beginning of lyfe is in Chriſt, out of whome we beginne to take roote in him. When he calleth hym ſelfe the true vine, it is as yf he had ſayd I am the vine in déede. Therefore men do weary themſelues in vain in ſéeking for ſtrength from any other: becauſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable fruite co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth from no other than from the branches ſpringing from mée.</p>
               <p>For Chriſt compareth him ſelfe to the vine growing in the earth, and vs to the braunches ſpringing out of the ſame.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bv.</hi> This allegory is taken out of the writinges of the Prophetes, who in diuers places compare the Church to the vinyarde, and men in the Church, to vines,<note place="margin">Pſal, 8.9, Eſ, 3, 13, 57 Ier, 2, 21, Ier, i2, i0 Oſee, i0. i,</note> and the workes of fayth, of loue, and of righteouſneſſe, to grapes. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when the Lord calleth him ſelfe the true vine, we muſt not ſo vnderſtande him as if hée were naturally and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantially a vine. For naturallye and ſubſtantially he is God and man, and not a vine: but repreſenteth the true, comely, fruitfull, noble, and plentifull vine. <hi>AVG.</hi> Therefore he is called a vine by a ſimilitude, not by proprietye euen as he is called a ſhéepe, a Lambe, a Lion, a Rock, a corner ſtone, &amp; ſuch like, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which ſuch ſimilitudes are brought.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>C.</hi> The Papiſtes notwithſtanding do not onelye extenuate this ſentence, but alſo wreſte, and dallye with the ſame.</p>
               <p>For although in worde onlye they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe, that we can doe nothing without Chriſt, yet notwithſtanding they fayne a certaine power in vs, which of it ſelfe is not ſufficient to worke, except it bée hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen with the grace of God. For they wyll not abyde that a man ſhould bée ſo empty and free from power and ſtrength to worke that which is good, but that hée maye doe ſomewhat of him ſelfe.</p>
               <p>But the wordes of Chriſt ſo plainlye ſpoken, cannot in ſuch wyſe be colloured. Such therefore is the imagination of the Papiſtes, that they affirme, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Chriſt we can doe nothing, and yet notwithſtanding being holpen by him, that we can doe ſomewhat of our ſelues without his grace. But Chriſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounceth the contrarye, as, that wée can doe nothing of our ſelues. The braunch (ſayeth hée) bringeth forth no fruite of it ſelfe. Therefore he doeth not onelye here commende the helpe of his grace which helpeth ioyntlye with him, but alſo depriueth vs whollye of all vertue and ſtrength, ſauing that aloane which he geueth vnto vs. <hi>Bv.</hi> Wherefore theſe wordes <hi>(VVithout mee)</hi> maye bée thus reſolued, <hi>Ye can doe nothing that is good, except ye haue ſtrength and power from me?</hi> So that a man can doe no good thing by humayne ſtrength: but as for euell he can doe of him ſelfe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>C.</hi> They haue yet another cauill: For they pretende that the braunche hath ſomewhat by his owne nature: becauſe if ſo bée another vnfruitefull braunche be grafted into the Vine, it wyll bring forth nothing. But this is eaſilye refuted: becauſe Chriſt doth not ſhewe here what the braunches haue in them before they bée in the Vine: but he rather ſheweth that then we beginne to bée braunches, when we growe togeather in him. Alſo, the Scripture in another place ſheweth, that before we are in him, we are drye and vnprofitable wood.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>M.</hi> Therefore wée muſt noate that he ſayeth not, <hi>VVithout you I can doe nothing,</hi> but, <hi>VVithout me ye can doe nothing.</hi> The Vine although hée looſe his vnfruitefull braunches, can neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe bring foorth of him ſelfe other

But the loue, of the which mencion is made here, is to be referred vnto our ſelues, becauſe Chriſt teſtifieth that hee is loued of the Father, in y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he is the head of the Church.

               <p>Some expounde theſe wordes, that Chriſt required of his Diſciples mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all loue. But otherſome much better, who take and vnderſtande the loue of Chriſt actiuely.</p>

The dignitye of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtleſhip was not an idle office, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it behoued them to fight and ſtriue with great perrilles.

The Byſhoppe of Rome hath ordayned ſuch in the Church at this daye, as goe not to bring fruite to the kingdome of GOD, but gather tribute and taxes, and to be nothing elſe but burthens to the earth, and conſumers of fruite. Theſe are Trées ordayned not to beare, but to deuoure fruite. And this ought not to ſeeme ſtraunge to any man, for they are not braunches of the true vine, but of the wylde vine. <hi>C.</hi> Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more, Chriſt reaſoneth here of the effect when he ſayeth,
<q>To bring foorth fruite,</q>
meaning hereby that theyr labours ſhal not be vaine and vnprofitable, if ſo bée they be ready and wylling to obaye.</p>
               <p>For he doeth not here onelye preſcribe what theyr vocation doeth requyre: but

alſo, leaſt they ſhoulde bee wearye and coulde, he promiſeth vnto them proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous ſucceſſe. For it cannot be that any man ſhoulde vſe paines and dilligence at his worke, except he hope that his labour wyll be profitable.</p>
               <p>It can not be vttered howe neceſſarye this conſolation is againſt ſo many tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations which daylye happen to the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of Chriſt. Therefore ſo often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times as they ſéeme to loaſe theyr labor, let them remember this, that Chriſt wyl at the leangth bring to paſſe that their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour ſhall not be in vaine.

               <q>And that your fruite ſhoulde remaine.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>C.</hi> Here it maye be demaunded, why Chriſt ſayeth that this fruite ſhalbe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall. Becauſe the doctrine of the Goſpell, wynneth foules vnto Chriſt, that they maye inherite euerlaſting life, this ſeemeth to be the perpetuitye of the fruite.

               <p>For the labour of the Apoſtles at this daye alſo doeth fructefye: and the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of Miniſters belongeth not vnto one age, but the Churche ſhall encreaſe, inſomuche that after theyr death, newe profite ſhall come.</p>

               <p>And theſe men are of twoo ſortes: Some are Hipocrites, who woulde ſéeme to bée followers of vertue, to hate vnrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, and to bée the true worſhippers of the true God, by the ſtoodye and loue of true Religion: when as in verye déede they are diſſemblers, neglectours of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, ſuperſticious men, &amp; vaine worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers of God by traditions of men.

               <p>Such were the moſt part of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles. And this world, or rather world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye men, cannot chooſe but hate the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of the Goſpell, and the Preachers of the ſame.

I aunſwere, Earthlye men whiche are lead by the ſcence and motion of the fleſhe, do neuer truely hate ſinne, but onely ſo farre foorth as they haue a care for their owne commodity and loſſe. Howbeit, the purpoſe of Chriſt was not to denye but that there was mortall war &amp; contencion among thoſe of the worlde: onely he minded ſo ſhewe that the world hated nothing but that whiche belonged to God in the Faithfull.

The wordes of Chriſt muſt bée kept for neceſſitye to come.

               <p>Therefore it is ignoraunce and blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, whiche maketh the worlde ſo boulde as to reſiſt Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Wée muſt alwayes then haue a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of the cauſe: and there is no true conſolation any where elſe in the teſtimony of a good conſcience.</p>

               </p>
               <p>For herevppon wée ought to bée mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to geue GOD thankes: becauſe when the worlde perriſheth in his owne blindneſſe, GOD geueth his lyghte vnto the Faythfull: euen as the palpable darkeneſſe compaſſed the <hi>Aegiptians</hi> rounde aboute, when the Children of Iſraell were in the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt lyght.</p>
               <p>Alſo wée muſt noate, that the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred of Chriſt commeth for want of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, when GOD is not knowne.

               <p>
                  <hi>Bv.</hi> As yf hee ſhoulde ſaye: If I had not come, and had ſo expreſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye and plainlye opened vnto them the miſteryes of the kingdome of GOD and the counſayle and loue of my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, they ſhould haue had no ſinne: but
<pb n="521" facs="tcp:14631:267"/>
nowe, ſeeing I the ſonne of God haue deſcended from heauen, and haue ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded all the miſteries of Gods king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and they them ſelues haue hearde and vnderſtoode all thinges, and yet would neyther knowe nor vnderſtande them, it cannot ſeeme ignoraunce which is maliciouſe obſtinacy and moſte wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked contempt of the knowen trueth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>C.</hi> In theſe words alſo Chrrſt ſéemeth to affirme, that only vnbeleefe is ſinne. And there are ſome which ſo think. For becauſe Faith remitteth and wypeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waye all ſynnes, they ſaye that there is but one ſinne of vnbeléefe which dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth.</p>
               <p>This is truely ſpoken: becauſe vnbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>léefe doth not only kéepe men from being deliuered from the deſert of condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but alſo is the well ſpring and cauſe of all euels. But all that diſputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on appertaineth nothing at all to this preſent place. For the name of ſynne is not taken generally, but for the circom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaunce of the cauſe in hand: as if Chriſt ſhould haue ſayd, that their ignoraunce was inexcuſable, becauſe they had ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liciouſly reiected God in his perſon: e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenas yf we ſhould cal him giltleſſe, iuſt, and pure, whom we would abſolue from one only fault, of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> which he was guilty Therefore this abſolution of Chriſt: is reſtrayned to one kinde of ſynne becauſe he taketh from the Iewes the pretence of ignoraunce in the contempt and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered of the Goſpell. Notwithſtanding there aryſeth yet a newe queſtion: as thus.</p>
               <p>Was not the vnbeléefe which was before the comming of Chriſt, ſufficient to condemne men? And they are madde men which gather amis of this place, that whoſoeuer dyed before the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of Chriſt without fayth, were in a doubtfull caſe, vntill ſuch tyme as Chriſt manifeſted him ſelfe vnto them. As though there were not many places of Scripture which teſtify that the only teſtimony of conſcience was ſufficiente for them to condemnation.<note place="margin">Rom. 5, 14,</note> 
                  <hi>Death</hi> (ſayeth Saint <hi>Paul</hi>) rayned in the world vntill Moyſes.<note place="margin">Rom. 2, 12</note> And in another place hee ſayeth that they ſhall peryſhe withoute Lawe, which haue ſynned without the Lawe.</p>
               <p>What then is the meaning of Chriſt? There is in theſe wordes a conceſſion or graunting becauſe he meaneth that the Iewes haue now nothing any more to excuſe their fault withal, ſeing that wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingly &amp; willingly they had reiected the life offered vnto them. And ſo the excuſe which he graunteth vnto them, doth not quyte abſolue them, but doth only exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuate the greatneſſe of the wickedneſſe according to this ſaying,<note place="margin">Lu. i2.47.</note> 
                  <hi>The ſeruaunte which knoweth his maiſters will and doth not the ſame shalbe beaten with many ſtripes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For it was not the purpoſe of Chriſt to promiſe pardon vnto others, but to kéepe vnder his enemies which had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinately reiected the grace of God, whereby it might plainly appeare that they were vnworthy of all pardon and mercy.</p>
               <p>And we muſt noate that he ſpeaketh not of his bare comming, but of that comming which was Ioyned with doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine. Neyther was it the preſence of his body that did ſo much condemne them as did the contempt of his doctrine, the which made them cleane without excuſe And vnder their perſon he mynded to make all others afeard, which doe ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reiect the truth of God offered vnto them, or elſe do opugne or withſtand the ſame when they know it. But although terrible vengeaunce hangeth ouer their heades. Chriſt notwithſtanding hath ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reſpect heare vnto his Diſciples, that he might encourage them with the vndoubted hope of victory, leſt at anye time they ſhould geue place vnto the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice and wickedneſſe of the wicked. For when we heare that ſuch deſtruction ſhalbe, we may then tryumphe, euenas it were in the middeſt of the battayle.</p>

But whether it be tranſpoſed or no it is a notable place, by which we are taught that no man hateth the doctrine of the Goſpell but he hateth God him ſelfe alſo Many profeſſe otherwiſe with theyre mouth.</p>
               <p>For when they abhorre the Goſpel they will ſéeme notwithſtanding to be exce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent worſhippers of God: but they are diſſemblers: for in their hartes lurketh the contempt of God. Thus it commeth to paſſe that by the light of his doctrine he bewrayeth the wickedneſſe and hipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſy of many. Concerning the whiche matter reade the third and fifte Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters going before. <hi>M.</hi> And this is the common error of the whole worlde that men think that they knowe, loue, and worſhippe God without Chriſt: and that they are not ignoraunt of GOD that they doe not reiect him, and hate him, when they are Ignoraunt of hys ſonne, when they reiect and hate him. Therefore by this ſaying of Chriſt they are condempned as haters of God which deteſt the trueth of Chriſtes doctrine, worſe than they doe a Dogge or ſerpent whether they bée Iewes, Turks, or falſe Chriſtians. <hi>C.</hi> This place There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore agréeeth with thoſe which we haue ſéene before as this, <hi>He which euel doth hateth the light.</hi>

               <p>For he did all thinges by hys owne power, neyther did he hurt to any man but profited al men <hi>C.</hi> For in this Chriſt excelled in miracles, becauſe he was not a ſeruaunt as were the reſt, but was properly the authoure himſelfe.

               <p>Moreouer by the name of workes, he comprehendeth all thoſe tokens of hys diuine glory which he ſhewed. For both by miracles, and by the power of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt and by other documentes alſo he plainly proued him ſelf to be the Son of God.</p>

               <p>Wherefore he was rather to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended of all men than to be hated.

               <p>And contrarywyſe there are ſome ſo farre out of their wittes that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not abyde externall preaching. But wée ſée howe Chriſte ioyneth theſe two togeather. Therefore although there bée no fayth vntyl the ſpirite of God doe il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luminate our mindes, and ſeale oure heartes: yet notwithſtanding, we muſt not ſéeke for viſions and Oracles from the cloudes: but the word which is néere vnto vs, in our mouth, and harte, oughte to haue all our ſcences occupyed and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtened to the ſame:<note place="margin">Eſa, 59.21.</note> euenas ſayth the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phete <hi>Eſay as: I will make this my coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunte with them (ſayeth the Lord) my ſpirite which I haue put vppon thee, and my words which I haue put in thy mouth, shall not departe out of thy mouth, nor out of the mouth of thy ſeede, &amp;c. R.</hi> So that this place confirmeth the authority and doctrine of the Apoſtles. For the Comforter ſuffereth the Apoſtles which are men to be weake ſtill in the fleſhe: but it maketh them mightie in doctrine that their worde might not be humayne but the word of God: for they preach the word of Chriſt. <hi>C.</hi> This clauſe,
<q>Becauſe ye haue been with me from the begin.</q>
was therefore added that wee mighte knowe that the Apoſtles deſerued the more credit, becauſe they were eye wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes of thoſe things which they ſpake. <hi>A,</hi> As we maye reade in diuers places but ſpecially in the Acts of the Apoſtles.<note place="margin">Acts. x. 41 2.

For ſéeing that contencions and battailes were prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for them, it was méete and conueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent that they ſhoulde be armed and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for the ſame. And withall he ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth them to vnderſtand that if ſo be they were well inſtructed in this Doctrine, they ſhoulde be able to fight. <hi>R.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore before Chriſt comforted his Apoſtls with the promiſe of the comforter, which comforteth and confyrmeth the heart in all aduerſity: and nowe he wylleth them to prepare themſelues for the Croſſe to come, leſt the wanes of aduerſitye flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vppon them, they ſhould bée offended and ſlyde from the trueth of the Goſpell. For thus fleſh &amp; blood is wont to reaſon, Yf this doctrine were true, it ſhould not haue ſo many aduerſaryes and perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours: againe, if he were the ſonne of God, &amp; the beloued of God, he ſhould not be ouerwhelmed with ſo many euilles. Againſt this offence Chriſt fortefyeth al his Apoſtles with his word, foreſhewing that they and the Faythfull ſhall ſuffer proſcription, perſecution, excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and be kylled, leaſt they ſhould ſaye as ignoraunt men are wont to doe, I wyſt not of it.</p>
               <p>For this is an oulde cuſtome that the Kinges, Princes, and Prelates of this worlde, ſhoulde perſecute the worde of trueth, and by all meanes afflicte the Preachers of the worde.<note place="margin">Luke. 6, 23,</note> So dyd they (ſaith he) vnto the Prophets which went before you. <hi>C.</hi> Therefore that which Chriſt ſayde then vnto the Apoſtles, is alſo ſpoken vnto vs. And fyrſt of all let vs noate that Chriſt ſendeth not his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles into the field vnarmed, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore none periſhe in this warrefare, but through the faulte of their owne coward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe. Neyther muſt we differre the time vntyll we come vnto preſent neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitye, but muſt rather endeuoure our ſelues, that we being acquainted and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarlye accuſtomed with theſe wordes of Chriſt, maye goe to the battayle when néede ſhal requyre. For there is no doubt but that we haue the victory in our hand ſo long as theſe admonitions of Chriſt ſhalbe faſt imprinted in our mindes. For when hée ſayeth,
<q>Becauſe ye ſhoulde not be offended.</q>
hée geueth vs to vnderſtande that there is no perryll, leaſt any thing ſhoulde tourne vs out of the right courſe.</p>
               <p>But hereby it appereth howe fewe there are which rightlye learne this doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, becauſe they whiche thinke that they haue this at theyr fingers endes without all daunger, when they ſhoulde come to fight hande to hande, fayle and ſlyde away euen as ignoraunt men that knowe nothing.</p>
               <p>Let vs therefore arme and fortefye our ſelues with ſuche weapons as wyl not fayle in tyme of neede.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>M.</hi> Hée is offended, whiche hath had any thinge happening vnto hym contrarye to his expectation.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="527" facs="tcp:14631:270"/>Hee whiche is offended doeth eaſylye goe backe and chaunge his minde. Becauſe therefore the Lorde Ieſus ſought wholy to exhorte his Diſciples to conſtancye and perſeueraunce, leſt they ſhould for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake him, but rather ſhoulde abide in him the true Vine, as good and fruitefull braunches, he doeth verye well foretell them of the perſecution to come, leſt when the ſame ſhoulde come they might bée offended, and ſo fall awaye.</p>
               <p>Therefore wée are here taught that they doe reaſon amiſſe of Predeſtinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, whiche doe exclude all dilligent ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king héede, to ſhonne euell. If ſo bee (ſaye they) the matter be ſo in deſtenies, that I ſhalbe offended and fall, it cannot bee let by any meanes but that I ſhalbe offended and fall, although I ſhonne e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerye ſtombling ſtoane of offence: if it be not in deſtinies, then alſo it ſhall not come to paſſe: and ſo al caution or taking heede is but vaine. If theſe thinges haue reaſon, then is that vaine whiche the Lord hath here ſpoken, <hi>Theſe thinges haue I ſpoken vnto you, becauſe yee shoulde not bee offended.</hi> But it is not in vaine, becauſe offence maye and ought to be auoyded.</p>
               <p>Therefore this admonition is verye profitable, and neceſſarye, if ſo be wée waye and conſider howe proane wée be to fall at euerye offence and ſtombling ſtoane.</p>
               <p>Yf ſo be the Apoſtles ought to feare of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, who had ſéene ſo many wonders done by Chriſt, what is it that we ought to feare, being inferiour vnto them?</p>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>M.</hi> Here he ſpeaketh of excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication, by which the Apoſtles were to be caſt out by the Rulers of the Iewes, out of the Churche of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>C.</hi> This was no light offence to trouble their mindes that they ſhould be driuen out of the company of the Godlye as wicked and naughtye men: and that of thoſe which hoaſt them ſelues to bée the people of God, and gloryed in the tytle of the Churche. Therefore in that hée ſayeth they ſhalbe excommunicated, his meaning is this, They ſhall caſt you out of theyr Sinagogues, they ſhall condempne you of impietye and hereſie, they wyll reſtraine you of water &amp; fyre, and ſuche neceſſaryes, they wyll baniſhe you and ſell your goodes, and they wyll account you, not for Iſraelites, but for Gentiles, and Athieſtes. <hi>C.</hi> For the Godlye are ſubiect, not onelye to perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions, but alſo to ignominy and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proche: Euen as ſayth the Apoſtle <hi>Paul, Mee thinketh that God hath ſet foorth vs which are the laſt Apoſtles,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">i. Cor. 4.9.</note> 
                  <hi>as it were men appointed vnto death: For we are made a gaſing ſtocke vnto the world, and to the Aungelles, and to men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Chriſt notwithſtanding commaundeth to ſtande fyrme and ſtedfaſt againſt this temptacion, becauſe though they bée thruſt out of Sinagogues, yet neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe, they ſhal abide in the kingdome of God.</p>
               <p>The ſum is, that we ought not to bée diſcouraged by the peruerſe iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of menne, but rather ſtronglye to beare the opprobrie and ſhame of the Croſſe of Chriſt: being contented with this one thing, that our cauſe whiche menne ſcornfully condemne, is allowed of God.</p>
               <p>Alſo hereby wée gather that the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of the Goſpell, are not onelye e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell intreated of the ſworne enemies of the Goſpell, but alſo ſometimes ſclan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, and euell ſpoken of, by thoſe which ſéeme to bée of the Churche, and of the houſhoulde of Chriſt, and Pyllers of the Churche. The Scribes &amp; high Prieſtes, by whom the Apoſtles were condemned, boaſted that they were apointed of God to bée the Iudges of the Churche. And in déede the ordinarye gouernment of the church was in their hands: &amp; the office of Iudging came from God, &amp; not from me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. But by their tyrrany they had corrupted the whoale order inſtituted of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="528" facs="tcp:14631:270"/>Thus it came to paſſe that the power which was graunted vnto them to edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fycation, was nothing elſe but ſiuyll op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of the ſeruauntes of God: ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication which ſhould haue bene a medicine to pourge the Churche, was conuerted to baniſhe all impietye out of the ſame.</p>
               <p>The which ſéeing the Apoſtles per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued in their age, there is no cauſe why wee ſhoulde be afrayde at this daye of the Popes curſe with the which he thret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth vs becauſe of the teſtimony of the Goſpell.</p>
               <p>For they canne doe vs no more harme than theſe ould excommunications dyd vnto the Apoſtles: nay we ought to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyer nothing more than to be out of that company, from whence Chriſte is ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed.</p>
               <p>But concerning excommunication and the abuſe of the ſame, read the ninth Chapter going before.</p>
               <q>But the time ſhall come</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>M.</hi> Chriſt ſheweth what great hatered of the worlde the Apoſtles were like to ſuſtayne. It might ſéeme a light matter to be expelled and caſte oute of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of ſome men. For what hurt was it to the Apoſtle to be expelled out of the Sinagogues of the Iewes? As thoughe they ſhould not ſhortly after haue gone out of the ſame, though they had not bene expelled.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>R.</hi> Therfore paraduenture it was tol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable ynough for them to ſuffer pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription and exile excepte the wicked ſhould haue vtterly killed the Godly. And peraduenture it was tollerable that they myghte alſo be ſlayne excepte the world ſhould acknowledge without blu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing that they doe wickedly, and ſhoulde openly confeſſe that it doth therefore kyl the Godly, becauſe they beleeue in God and becauſe they haue taught that which is godly: but the world is ſo farre from confeſſing this that it will rather bee thought to doe well, and to doe God good ſeruice by ſlaying the godly. This is the true croſſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>C.</hi> For nowe of it ſelfe it is a verye harde matter for the Godly to be cruelly vexed. but it is much more ſharpe and gréeuouſe, that the Iniuryes, whiche are done vnto the childeren of GOD by the wicked ſhould be counted for iuſt &amp; due puniſhmentes belouging to their faltes But we muſt be ſo ſtrong and boulde in a good conſcience, that we muſt patient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſuffer our ſelues to be ſo oppreſſed, till Chriſt ſhall appeare from heauen, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fende our and his cauſe, who wyll take vengeaunce vppon thoſe which haue not knowen God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>C.</hi> But it is merueile that the enemies of the trueth when their owne conſcience doth accuſe them, can beare ſuch a fayre ſhewe not onely before men, but alſo challenge vnto them ſelues prayſe bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, for theyr moſt wicked cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tye.</p>
               <p>Wee aunſwere. Hipocrites although their owne conſcience doth accuſe them yet notwithſtanding they always flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and deceiue them ſelues. They are ambitiouſe, cruell, and prowde, but yet they couer all theſe vices with the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of zeale, by which they promiſe vnto them ſelues impunitye. To this alſo is ioyned a ſertayne furiouſe dron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſſe, after they haue imbrued them ſelues wyth the bloud of martyres.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>R.</hi> Wherefore the worlde beeing wyſe, will not ſéeme to doe euell, to perſecute the worde of the Lord nor to kill the true Euaungeliſtes.</p>
               <p>For it profeſſeth that it loueth and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noreth theſe, it profeſſeth that it belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth the word of the Lord: but it ſayeth that it will not beare with bringers in of newe thinges, with the diſturbers of the peace and with the contempners of humaine and diuine ryghteouſneſſe: and that it doth not beleeue their worde to be the word of God, but rather a fained im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magination found out to trouble and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbe all Religion and loue of hone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtye.</p>
               <p>And thus are the godlye ſlayne of the world as the authours of all euell, &amp; that not without ſhewe of perſwation, and probable reaſonne</p>
               <p>For Chriſt alſo hym ſelfe was faſtened to the Croſſe, not as the ſonne of God, but as an enemie vnto him.</p>

                  <hi>R.</hi> So his diſciples were thought vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy to liue vpon the earth. <hi>A.</hi> Wher<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore we being in ſuche ſtraytes, let vs imbrace the worde of the Lorde Ieſu with a liuely fayth, let vs in pacience poſſeſſe our ſoules.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <hi>3. And ſuche thinges will they doe vnto you: becauſe they haue not knowne the Father, neither yet me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>C.</hi> Chriſt doth not in vayne bring his Apoſtles vnto this conſideration, that there is one onely cauſe why the vnbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>léeuing doe ſo rage againſt the godlye, namely, becauſe they knowe not God. Notwithſtanding this is not ſpoken to extenuate their fault, but rather that the Apoſtles might with a good courage deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſe their blinde madneſſe. <hi>R.</hi> As yf he ſhould ſaye, They boaſte of GOD: but they knewe not GOD becauſe they perſecute the worde of God: And he which perſecuteth the worde of God, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuteth God himſelfe: and knoweth not God, although he boaſte of him.</p>
               <p>For God is knowne by his worde, which is the Sonne of God. <hi>C.</hi> Moreouer by theſe wordes wee are taught, what great wickedneſſe the ignoraunce of God is, whiche maketh them to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mende and prayſe murder.</p>

                  <hi>A.</hi> The lyke ſentence is to be reade in the Chapter going before, which is the one and twentie verſe, the expoſition whereof may be applyed to this place.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>M.</hi> It ſemeth that theſe thinges were ſpoken to preuent that which might bée eyther ſpoken or thought.

Yf ſo be thou hadeſt foretoulde vs of theſe thinges at the firſt when thou dideſt call vs, we mighte haue better prouided for our ſelues. He ſo preuenteth this thoughte, that he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clareth wherefore he tolde them not in the beginning of theſe troubles to come. <hi>C.</hi> For the Apoſtles being as yet but young ſchollers and weake ſo long as Chriſt was with them in the fleſh, there gentle and louing Schoolemaſter bare with them, and would not burthen them wyth more then they might well beare. Therefore they hadde then no great néede of confirmation, when

For they which vntill now had liued peaceablelye and at eaſe, were appoynted afterwarde to abide greeuous conflictes. What then might haue come to paſſe, except they had knowne that Chriſt was the heade of their ſaluation. For to goe vnto the Father is nothing elſe, but to be recey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued into heauenly glorie, to raigne with imperiall power, This therefore was ſet before them for a ſolace and remedy of their ſorrowe, becauſe Chriſt beinge abſent in body, ſhall ſite, notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, at the right hande of his Father, to defende the faithfull by his power.</p>
               <p>But this ſemeth to be falſely obiected a gainſt the Apoſtles, that they do not aſke whether their maſter goeth: ſeing it was the firſt queſtion which very ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly they demaunded.</p>

               <p>It is the proper Office of the Law to call mens Conſciences to the Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God, and to wounde them with feare: but the Goſpell cannot be right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly preached, but it muſte bring from ſin to righteouſenes, and from death to lyfe.

But when we come to the matter it ſelfe, the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtes are very vayne &amp; ridiculouſe. For they define and afirme that thoſe ſecretes with the Apoſtles were not able to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue and comprehende, were but chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſhe and trifeling ioyes, then the which there can be nothing more vaine and fooliſh.</p>
               <p>They woulde haue forſooth the holy Ghoſt to deſcend from heauen to teach the Apoſtles how, to conſecrate their chalices with their altares, how to baptize belles, and to make holy water, and how to ſelebrat maſſes. But how do fooles and children learne, which haue all theſe thinges at their fingers endes, very perfecte? <hi>M</hi> Theſe are Iolly fellowes, which place the Inſtruction, and reuelation of the holy ghoſt, in the Church after the Goſpel: as though thoſe thinges alone which Chriſt taught in the fleſh, and which the diſciples could con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue, pertayned to the Goſpell: and that thoſe thinges which the holy ghoſte taught after the departure of Chriſt, which the Apoſtles coulde not conceyue and carrye before they had receyued the holy Ghoſt, are theſe notable and erce lent ceremonyes of dayes, of meales of garmentes and ſuch lyke. <hi>B.</hi> For they contend &amp; affirme that theſe many thinges which Chriſt ſaith his Apoſtles coulde not beare as yet, are to be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoode to be thoſe ceremonies whiche haue crept into the Churche, and whiche are very gainefull vnto them.</p>
               <p>But what can be more fooliſhlye ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken? <hi>R.</hi> For ſéeing thoſe ceremonies doe ſauour more of the fleſhe than they doe of the ſpirite, how coulde it be that they ſhoulde be reuealed by the ſpirite, when the ſpirite and the fleſhe are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarye one to the other?</p>
               <p>Let vs therefore, except we will bée vnthankefull vnto GOD, ſtaye oure ſelues and be contented with that doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of the whiche the Apoſtles are au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours, as the Scripture doth teſtify: ſeeing the full perfection of heauenlye wiſdome is contayned in them, whiche maye make the man of God perfect.</p>

               <p>Euen as in another place it is called the earneſt by which God hath eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed our ſaluation, and the ſeale,<note place="margin">Ephe. i. i3</note> by which he ſealeth the ſertaynty of the ſame vnto vs. To conclude, the purpoſe of Chriſt was to teach that the doctrine of the ſpirite was not of this world,<note place="margin">Iohn. 17.</note> but that it came out of the heauenly ſanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary euenas Chriſt often times teſtifieth of his doctrine.</p>

               <p>After this error there followeth an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther no leſſe intollerable, as that Chriſt hauing nowe taken his leaue,<note place="margin">Gala. 3, 24</note> and bée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing entered into hys kingdome, had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to do, and had appoynted the holye Ghoſt to be in his place.

For although theſe Antichriſtes are much vnlyke one to the other in many thinges yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding they haue all one begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</p>
               <p>For, they ſaye that by the Goſpell we are entered into the right fayth, but yet that we muſt ſéeke for the perfection of doctrne from another.

               <p>The worke of the holye Ghoſt is not to gloryfye our ſtrength, wiſdome, and merittes, but Chriſt: which cannot bee glorifyed but in our heartes mortefyed, and voyde of our owne ryghteouſneſſe. <hi>C.</hi> When Chriſt addeth that the holye Ghoſte ſhall take of his he geueth vs to vnderſtande that we receiue his ſpirite to this ende, that we might enioye his benefits.</p>
               <p>For what doth it profite vs?

               <p>Herevppon the Prophet ſayth, <hi>Sorrow and mourne, O daughter Syon, lyke a woman in trauele:</hi>

For the faithful are lyke vnto a woman whiche hath brought foorth a Childe, in that they are borne againe in Chriſt, and are already entered into the celeſtiall kingdome of God, and euerlaſting lyfe: but they are like vnto great bellyed and traueilyng Women in that as yet they are captiues in the priſon of the fleſhe, wayting for that happy ſtate whiche ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth hid from their eyes.</p>

               <p>Agayne it is not lyke that they were ſo long conuerſaunt with Chriſt, but that they obſerued that rule and forme of prayer which the lawe preſcribed.</p>

                  <hi>C.</hi> As yet the externall vaile of the Temple remayned, the maieſty of God was hid vnder the Cherubin, the true high Prieſt was not yet entred into the true Sanctuary of Heauen to make in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion for his brethern, as yet he had not made the way by his bloud.</p>
               <p>It is no maruell then yf ſo be the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator was not ſo well knowne then as he is now, being entered into heauen to appeare before the Father for vs, recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilinge vs vnto him by his ſacrifice, that we miſerable wretches might approche thither vnto him with bouldnes.</p>
               <p>For Chriſte, when he had ended the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concilliation, was receiued vp into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen and ſhewed him ſelfe openly to be the Mediatour.</p>
               <p>Moreouer we muſt note here the often repetition of this, that we muſt pray and call vpon God in the name of Chriſte: to the end we may knowe, that it is a wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked prophanation of the name of God, when a man dare preſume to come be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Tribunall ſeat of God without Chriſt.

               <p>How far then are they from the minde of Chriſte whiche pray not vnto the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but vnto creatures, neither in his name, but in the name of this or that Sainct? <hi>C.</hi> For we are ſayd to pray in the name of Chriſt, when we make him our aduocate, to purchaſe grace for vs fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his Father, although we expreſſe not his name with our lips.</p>

               <p>Therefore he telleth them that the time wyll ſhortly come, when they ſhall féele the fruite of his doctryne, the whiche by the obſcurenes of the ſame, might bring a lothing and contempt therof into their mindes. <hi>M,</hi> But becauſe to ſpeake by prouerbs is to ſpeake by obſcure and darke ſentences, it maye here be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded wherefore he ſpake vnto his Diſciples by prouerbs, when the knew that they vnderſtood not his words, and mighte haue diferred them vntill that time, in the whiche he minded to ſpeake more playnly and manyfeſtly of theſe thinges: Anſwer maye be made thus Chriſt though he ſpeake ſomwhat dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, yet notwithſtandinge in ſuche wyſe that his Diſciples might haue eaſely vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood him: but ſo great was their rude<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nes that they ſtoode as it were amazed when they hard him ſpeake.</p>
               <p>Wherefore this obſcureneſſe was not ſo much in his doctrine as it was in their mindes. And verely the lyke happeneth to vs at this daye. For the word of God hath not his title in vaine, that it is the light of our pathes: but the darkneſſe which is in vs doth ſo obſure &amp; darcken the brightnes therof, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we think we here nothing but allegories and parables.</p>
               <p>For as he threatneth to the reprobate, that he wyll ſpeake vnto them in a ſtraunge and barbarous tongue, with ſtammering ſpeache: and the Apoſtle Paule ſaith that the Goſpell is hidden to ſuch, becauſe Sathan hath blinded their minds: euen ſo to the weke and ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noraunt many things ſéeme obſcure and hard to be vnderſtood: for although their myndes are not altogether darkeneſſe, as the mindes of Infidels are, yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtandi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g they are as it wer darkened with cloudes.</p>
               <p>And the Lorde to humble vs with the féeling of our owne neede, doth ſuffer vs for a time to be thus dull: but he mak<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>eth thoſe, whome he illumineth with his ſpirite, to profit ſo, that the ſame worde is eaſy and famillier vnto them.</p>
               <p>But there may yet this queſtion be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded. How doth our ſauiour Chriſt ſaye in another place, that it is geuen to his Diſciples to knowe the miſteries of Gods kingdome, to whom he confeſſeth here that he ſpeaketh in a darke ſpeach, For there he did put a differaunce be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twéene them and the commen ſorte of people, becauſe he ſpake to the people in parables.</p>
               <p>I anſwer. There was not ſuch rudenes and ignoraunce in the Apſtoles, but that they had ſome vnderſtandinge of that which their maſter ſpake.</p>
               <p>So that he doth not withoute cauſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt them from the number of ſuch as are blinde. And now he ſaithe that his ſpeach was allegoricall vnto them in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecte of that manyfeſt light of vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandyng, which he ment ſhortly to geue vnto them by the grace of his ſpirit.</p>
               <p>Boath therefore are true, namely, that they ſhould farre excell them which had no ſauor or taſt of the Goſpell: and for all that ſhould as yet be lyke vnto yonge Scollers, in reſpecte of that newe wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome which the Spirite brought vnto them: which cryeth in the hartes of the faithfull Abba, Father, and bringeth with it moſte ample knowledge of the Father.</p>

               <p>Of this, Chriſt putteth his Diſciples in mynde, and pronounceth that it wyll ſhortly come to paſſe that they ſhal for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake him. And this interrogation of Chriſt is Ironicall: as yf he hadde ſayd, Do ye thus boaſt, as though ye were ſtrong in fayth: A tryal is at hand wich will plainlye ſhewe your imbecillitie.

               <p>Therefore, not onely the ſonne but the Father alſo him ſelfe, is ſo vnknowne and obſcure in this world (and that not amoung the Gentiles onely but alſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounge the Iewes) that he can not bée glorified, but by his ſonne.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>B.</hi> Moreouer the ſonne glorifyed the Father when he manifeſted hys power and goodneſſe: and the Father glorifieth the ſonne, in that hée hath exalted hym, ſet him on his right hand, to be the Lord and Sauiour of all, and hath made hym to bée knowen by the preachyng of the Goſpell. This thing the Lorde plaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ynough declareth when hée ſayeth as foloweth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>As thou haſt giuen him power ouer all fleſh, that he ſhoulde giue eternall lyfe to as manye as thou haſt giuen him.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>R.</hi> Thys is that glory wyth the which the father glorifyed the ſonne, namely that he might be the Author of euerlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing life to all men, which beleue in him: which are ment, by thys worde, fleſhe. For thys is the wyll of the Father that euery one which ſéeth the Sonne,<note place="margin">Iohn 6, 46</note> and beléeueth in hym ſhoulde haue eternall lyfe. But to be a Medtator to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and to to be the Author of euerlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng lyfe, is not greater honour and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye. <hi>C.</hi> The power ouer all fleſhe, ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth the Rule and dominion, whych was gyuen vnto Chriſt, when the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther appoynted hym to be the King and heade.

Chriſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore toke vpon hym rule and power not ſo much for hymſelfe, as for our ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. So that it is méete that wee wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linglye ſubmitte our ſelues vnto Chriſt not onelye to obay God but alſo becauſe there is nothing more amiable than that ſubiection, ſeyng it is vnto vs the cauſe of euerlaſting lyfe. <hi>M.</hi> But as touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thys preſent place, we ſée that eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall life is the gyfte of Chriſt and not the rewarde of our merits: Secondlye that thys gyft is ſtayed vppon the power of God, gyuen to the ſonne. Thirdly,<note place="margin">Life eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall is the free gift of god.</note> that euerlaſting lyfe is not geuen to euerye one, but onelye to the electe whome the Father hath giuen to the Sonne <hi>C</hi> For chriſt ſaith not, that he hath rule ouer the whole worlde, to giue lyfe vnto all men<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> without exceptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but he reſtraineth this grace to thoſe onelye which are gyuen vnto hym. But howe are they gyuen? For the Father hath alſo made the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate ſubiect vnto hym. Aunſwere, Only the electe are of the peculiar flock of Chriſt, the cuſtody and charge wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he hath taken vppon hym as a ſhepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearde. Therefore the kingdome of Chriſt is extended to al men: but it brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth ſaueing helth to the elect only, who gladly and willyingly follow the voyce of the ſhepehearde. For others he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrayneth violently to obey hym, vntyll at the laſt he breake them in peces with an Iron maule. <hi>A.</hi> Therefore thys place agréeth very well with that which we redde before, where it is ſayde.</p>

               <p>For they were, as were others al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, by nature the children of wrath. But concerning this we haue ſpoken more in the fiftéene chapter before,

And verely except wee know him in Chriſte, wee muſt needes continuallye wauer and be vnſtayed. <hi>R.</hi> Therefore becauſe the elect doe beleeue the Goſpell, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they knowe that it is no humayne inuention, but the worde of the Father come from the Father, and the power of God to ſaluation to euery one that beleeueth. But the worde of the Croſſe to them which periſhe, is fooliſhneſſe.<note place="margin">Rom. 1.16. 1.

Whoſoeuer there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore receyueth the goſpell of CHRIST by fayth he ſhall truelye knowe Chryſt, who beyng knowne, GOD is alſo knowne.

               <p>

And hee ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth after hys manner in the Perſonne of the Mediatoure, when he ſaith that hee hath taught that onelye, whych hée had receyued of the Father.</p>
               <p>For becauſe thys condicion in the fleſh was as yet baſe, and becauſe vnder the fourme of a Seruaunt hys deuyne ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtye laye hydde, hee aſſygneth GOD vnder the perſon of the Father. Neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe we muſt remember that whych Saynte Iohn in the begynnyng, howe that Chryſte, in that hee is the eternall worde of GOD, was alwayes one GOD wyth the Father, Therefore the meanynge is, that Chryſte was a faythfull wytneſſe of GOD vnto the Diſciples, that theyr fayth myghte bee founded vppon none other than vppon the worde of GOD, ſeyng the Father hymſelfe hath ſpoken in the Sonne.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>M.</hi> Here therfore wee ſee that Chriſt delyuereth nothyng to hys Dyſciples<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but that whych he hadde receyued from the Father, ſo much doe althynges de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pende vppon the woorde of GOD, that the Sauiour hymſelfe the Sonne of GOD, woulde preach nothynge elſe vnto mortall men, then the worde of hys Father, geuen vnto hym to thys ende, that hee might preache the ſame vnto the worlde. Let then the teachers of humaine tradicions bee aſhamed of their great preſumption, in tying the conſciences of men to humaine tradici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and imaginations: when there can come no peace of conſcience but from the woorde of God, delyuered to the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles by the Sonne of God.</p>
               <q>And they haue knowne ſurelie, that I came out.</q>
               <p>That which hee had touched before hee nowe repeateth in other wordes. For Chriſte to come out from the Father, and to bee ſent of the Father, is euen as muche as that which wente before, where Chriſte ſayth, that whatſoeuer he hath is of the Father. <hi>M</hi> He might haue made mention of ſygnes, whiche teſtifie alſo, that he came out from God: but this is the noate of the Children of God, to beléeue his worde. <hi>C.</hi> The ſume is this, that fayth ought rightlye to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houlde Chriſt, but ſo that it déeme and iudge no earthlye or contemptible thing to be in him: and that it ought to be lif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vp to his deuine power, that it may certainelye be perſwaded that God, and whatſoeuer belongeth vnto God is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fytelye in him. <hi>B.</hi> Behoulde here there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the order of ſaluation. Firſt of all the Goſpell is preached to the elected: then it is giuen vnto them to beléeue: thirdelye in the Goſpell, and by it, God is knowne: hereof by and by ſpring a truſt in him, and the loue of him: from whence conſequentlye groweth the loue and deſire of pietie and holyneſſe, and alſo the duetye which we owe vnto oure brethren.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>C.</hi> Alſo we maye noat that in the firſt parte of this ſentence Chriſt vſeth this worde <hi>(knowen)</hi> and in the latter part this worde <hi>(beleue)</hi> For there by he tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth vs that wee cannot knowe God truly without fayth: in the which there is ſuch aſſuraunce and ſertayntie, that it is rightly called knoweledge, <hi>A.</hi> How Chriſt went out from the Father wee haue ſhewed before.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>C.</hi> So that he playnly affirmeth that he prayeth not for the worlde: becauſe he cared for his owne flocke only, which he had receiued of his Fathers hande. Notwithſtanding this might ſeeme very abſurde.</p>
               <p>For there cannot be a better Rule of prayer deuiſed, then if wee follow Chriſt our Captayne and mayſter.<note place="margin">Math. 5, 4</note> But we are commaunded to praye for all men, yea euen for our enemies.<note place="margin">i, Tim, 2, 1,</note> Alſo the Apoſtle exhorteth that before al things, prayers ſupplications, interceſſions, and thanks geuing be made for all men.<note place="margin">Luk. 23, 34</note>

               </p>
               <p>We ought to wiſh this and that man to be ſaued and ſo to comprehende all mankind becauſe as yet we cannot di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh the elect from the Reprobate yet notwithſtanding we praye there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall for the comming of Gods king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, wiſhing that he would deſtroy his enemies.</p>
               <p>This is euen as much as to praye for the ſaluation of all men whom wée knowe to be created after the Image of GOD, and which are of the ſame nature that we are of and do leaue their deſtruction to the Iudgement of GOD whom he knoweth to be reprobates. There was another ſertayne ſpetiall cauſe of this prayer, which ought not to be drawen into example. For Chriſtes prayer procéeded not only from the bare ſcence of fayth and loue, but alſo from the féeling of his fathers ſecret Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes which are hidden from vs, ſo long as we walke through faith.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>M.</hi> Therefore becauſe wee knowe not who they are which ſo appertayne vnto the world that they can neuer be drawen away from the ſame, it is méete that wée wiſhe well vnto all men, and to declare our good wil by praier. <hi>C.</hi> Furthermore by theſe wordes we gather, that they whome it pleaſeth God to loue out of this world ſhalbe heirs of eternall lyfe: and that this difference depended not vp<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>on mans merites but vpon the méere good will and grace of God.</p>
               <p>For the which place the cauſe of electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in men muſte fyrſt beginne with fayth.</p>
               <p>Chriſt plainly pronounceth that they were the fathers whiche were geuen
<pb n="561" facs="tcp:14631:287"/>
vnto him.</p>
               <p>And it is ſertayne that they are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore geuen, that they might beléeue, and that fayth commeth of this donation. If ſo be this donation bée the originall of faith, and that election go beefore the ſame, what elſe can followe but that we confes that they are fréely choſen, whom God will haue to be ſaued from amonge the reſt of the worlde? Nowe, ſéeing Chriſt prayeth only for the elect, the fayth of election is neceſſary for vs, if ſo be we will haue our ſaluation commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to him of the father. Therefore they doe great iniury to the faithfull, which ſéeke to race oute of their mindes the knoweledg of their election, to the ende they might depriue them of the helpe of Chriſte.</p>
               <p>They alſo are here reprooued whiche vnder the pretence of their election: geue them ſelues to all licentiouſeneſſe of life and to negligence and ſleweth in the work of the Lord: whenas the ſame ought rather to mooue them to all god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe, euenas Chriſt teacheth by hys ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, whereas Chriſt pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not for the worlde but only for the elect it bringeth great horror and feare. For, for this cauſe, the world ronneth headlong to all kynde of wickedneſſe, to death, to hell, and into euerlaſting con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dempnation, for only the vnbeléeuinge for whom Chriſt prayeth, ouercome in Chriſt through prayer all the euelles of the world, and of the Deuell. But the world by the Iuſt Iudgement of God is geuen ouer into a reprobate mynde, and is lefte vnto his owne will and pleaſure Wherefore as it liueth wickedly, ſo by the horrible Iudgement of God it is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demned. <hi>M.</hi> Here alſo we are taught to loue theſe hartely, whom we knowe to belong vnto Chriſte and to the father and for that cauſe to make our earneſt prayers vnto God for them.</p>
               <p n="10">
                  <hi>10. And all mine ar thine and thine are mine, and I am glorified in them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>R.</hi> This is a confyrmation of Chriſtes prayer. For Chriſt obtaineth that at the hands of the father which he prayeth for, becauſe al things belonging to the father are his: the which he would not haue ſayd, yf he had not bene the ſonne equall with the father. <hi>M.</hi> To the father bée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth the ſempiternal diuinitie wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, power, goodneſſe, all honor and glory, heauen, earth, and all thinges in them, Aungels, men, and whatſoeuer elſe: therefore all theſe thinges alſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long vnto Chriſt, whom the father hath made heire of all thinges. <hi>C.</hi> Chriſte therefore ſpeaketh this to ſhewe that he ſhall ſertainly be heard of the father.<note place="margin">Hebr. i. 2.</note> As if he ſhould ſaye. I commend no other vnto thée than thoſe whom thou know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt to be thyne owne, becauſe I haue nothing which thou haſte not. Therfore I will not be denied. <hi>R.</hi> Notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding he ſéemeth heare to ſpeake ſpetially of the electe. Theſe thinges are ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon vnto the father and to Chriſt, that Chriſt taketh none to be ſaued but thoſe whome the father hath elected for the ſame purpoſe: and all thoſe whom God hath elected, thoſe Chriſt taketh into his charge and ſaueth. When he addeth,
<q>And J am glorified in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  </q>
he ſheweth that he hath iuſte cauſe to haue care for the electe and to ſéeke their ſaluation, ſeeing they ſeeke whollye to ſette forth his glory. As if he ſhould ſaye I am now going out of the world, theſe ſhall abyde in the world and ſhall glorify me, that is to ſaye they ſhall preach to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whole world my victory and triumphe ouer ſinne, death, and hell, <hi>C.</hi> And this is a notable confirmation of our faith that Chriſt wil neauer ceaſſe to haue care for our ſaluation if ſo be he be gloryfyed, And to gloryfy Chriſt is fyrſt of all to beleeue in him as in the ſonne of God: ſecondly for his ſake to doe and ſuffer al thynges, thirdly to ſeeke dilligently to bring al men to beleue in him to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe his name, and to imbrace his truth: and fourthly to expreſſe his ſpirite in al things by the exerciſe of true godlineſſe. Al which thinges are loked for at their handes which are geuen to Chriſt of the father.</p>

                  <hi>11. And now am I not in the worlde, and they are in the woorlde, and I come too thee, Holy father kepe tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough thy owne name them which thou haſt giuen me, that they may alſo be one, as we are.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>C.</hi> Nowe he addeth another cauſe why he prayed ſo earneſtly for hys Diſciples, bicauſe ſhortly they ſhould be deſtitute of his corporall preſence, by enioying the whiche they were as yet cherefull. So long as he was conuerſaunt with them, he gathered them, and nouriſhed them, euen as a Henne doth hir Chickens, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his winges: and nowe gooing away, he deſireth of the Father to protect and defende them: the whiche he dothe in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of them. For he ſéeketh to remedie their feare, that they mighte ſtaye them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues vpon God him ſelfe, to whome he nowe deliuered them as it were from hande to hande.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>M.</hi> Therefore nowe we ſee howe the moſte faythfull and louyng Lorde was not ſo deſirous to go vnto the Father, that he regarded not the condition of his Diſciples, but carefully conſidereth in what ſtate to leaue them after his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture. Héereof commeth no ſmall conſolation, when wee heare that the Lorde is the more carefull for the ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation of hys, when he leaueth them according to hys Corporall preſence. For heereof wee maye gather, that we alſo at thys day labouring in the world, are regarded of hym, in ſo muche that hee ſendeth helpe vnto vs when wee are in trouble, euen from hys heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly glory.</p>
               <q>Holy Eather kepe tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough thy owne name.</q>

As if he ſhould ſay, My Apoſtles ſhall abyde perſecution of the worlde for the Goſpell. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I praye that they faynte not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the heauie burthen of the croſſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>M.</hi> He addeth: <hi>In thy name.</hi> For bicauſe they were conſecrated to the name of God, and ſhoulde ſuffer ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny aduerſities in the worlde for his ſake, he prayeth that they maye bee preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in or by hys name. <hi>R.</hi> For the name of GOD is a moſt ſtrong tower.<note place="margin">Prou. 18.10.</note> Therefore the name of GOD can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fende the Faythfull man from all e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uils, and from the dartes of Sathan.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>C.</hi> The ſumme then is thys, When the Corporall ſighte of Chryſte is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from the Diſciples, they ſuſtayne no loſſe, bycauſe God receyueth them into his protection, whoſe power is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlaſting. He aſcribeth the maner of ſauing, ſaying:
<q>That they may be one.</q>
               </p>
               <p>For thoſe whome the heauenly Father hath decreed to ſaue, he gathereth into the holy vnitie of fayth and of the ſpirit. But bicauſe it is not ſufficient for me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to agrée togither in one, he addeth this:
<q>Euen as we are one.</q>
               </p>
               <p>For then our vnitie ſhall be happie, if ſo be it ſet foorth the Image of God the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and of Chriſt: euen as the waxe in the which the King or Signet is printed, carieth the marke or print of the ſame. <hi>A.</hi> But concerning y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vnitie of the father and the ſonne, reade the tenth Chapter going before, beginning at the .30. verſe, and in the verſe folowing.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>C.</hi> Chriſte ſayth that he hath kepte them in hys Fathers name, bicauſe he made hym ſelfe onely a Myniſter, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che dyd nothyng but by the power of GOD.

Wherefore I reſigne them ouer into thy hande, that they maye bee preſerued from all euill.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>C.</hi> But this ſéemeth very abſurde, that Chryſte ſhoulde ſette ouer vnto GOD the offyce of ſauyng and preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, as thoughe he hauyng ended the courſe of hys lyfe, leaſſed to bee their kéeper.</p>
               <p>But this is thus aunſwered, That Chryſte ſpeaketh onely héere of the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible cuſtodie, whiche had an ende in the death of Chriſte. For ſo long as he was conuerſaunte on earth, he needed not to borrowe any other power to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue hys Diſciples. But all this is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred too the perſon of the Mediator, whiche appeared in the fourme of a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunte for a tyme. But nowe he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundeth his Diſciples, ſo ſoone as they beginne to wante but the leaſt helpe, to lyfte vp theyr eyes to heauen. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by wée gather, that Chryſte dothe no leſſe preſerue the faythfull at this daye, than he hathe doone in tyme paſte: but after an other manner: becauſe the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyne Maieſtie openly ſhineth in him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>R.</hi> For if ſo be Chriſte kepte and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued hys, before hee entered into the Kyngdome of hys Father, and ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed the deſire of the Faythfull concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng ioye, howe muche more ſhall he keepe them nowe, ſeeing he hathe iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied them by hys Deathe and Reſurrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?

For ſuche is thys worlde, that the Electe haue nede of Gods preſeruation, ſo long as they are in the ſame. <hi>C.</hi> Whereas he maketh exception heere of Iudas, it is not wyth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out cauſe: For althoughe he were none of the Elect, and of Gods flocke, yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding the dignitie of his office, made him ſeeme ſo to be. Neither woulde any man haue thought otherwiſe of hym, ſo long as he was in that office. Therefore (in reſpect of Grammer) the exception is improper: but if we conſider the matter, all men will ſay that it behoued Chriſte ſo to ſpeake. Moreouer leſt any man ſhuld thinke that the eternall election of God was voyde in the deſtruction of Iudas, he addeth héerewithal that he was the ſonne of perdition: by whiche words he giueth to vnderſtand, that his ruine and deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which ſodenly appeared in the ſight of men, was from the beginning knowne vnto God.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="564" facs="tcp:14631:288"/>It appeareth therefore very well, that Chryſte knewe for whome he prayed, and for whome he prayed not. <hi>M.</hi> By this perdition of Iudas wée may gather that there is no hope of ſaluation for thoſe, whiche following the ſteppes of Iudas, perſecute the truthe of Chryſte for filthye gayne, whereby they many<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly declare that they are borne the children of perdition: ſeeyng the ſame happened too a familiar Apoſtle of Chryſte.</p>
               <q>That the Scripture might be fulfilled.</q>
               <p>By this place a man ſhoulde gather amiſſe, that the fall of Iudas ſhoulde rather be imputed to GOD, than to him ſelfe, bicauſe of the neceſſitie whiche was layde vppon hym by the Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie. For the ſucceſſe and ſequell of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters oughte not therefore to be aſcribed vnto Propheſies, bicauſe the ſame is there foreſhewed. Neyther doo the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetes propheſie anye other thyng than the verye ſame whiche ſhoulde come to paſſe, though they helde their peace. Therefore wée muſte not thynke the cauſe of any thing to be in them. Moſt certayne it is that nothing happeneth but by the ordinaunce of GOD: but the queſtion is nowe onely concerning the Scripture, whether their predicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Propheſies bring any neceſſitie with them to men, or no: the whiche wée haue ſhewed alreadie to bee falſe. Neyther was it the purpoſe of Chriſte, to impute the cauſe of the deſtruction of Iudas, vnto the Scripture: but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to take away the occaſion of offence, whiche mighte trouble weake myndes. And the reaſon why offence myghte be taken awaye, was, bicauſe the ſpirite of God had before teſtified that the ſame ſhoulde ſo come to paſſe. For common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at newe and vnwonted things we are muche afrayde.</p>
               <p>This is a very neceſſarie admonition. For how co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth it to paſſe at thys day, that the greater parte of men ſo eaſily fall at euery ſtumbling blocke, but bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they remember not the teſtimonies of Scripture?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> But of what Scripture is this that Chriſte ſpeaketh: for he expreſſeth not the place, no more than he dydde in the eyghtéenth verſe of the thirteenth Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter before? <hi>B.</hi> Wée muſt note that as what ſoeuer is written of the afflictions of the Sainctes, the ſame dothe belong to the Lorde, the head of the Sainctes, yea, and is fulfilled in hym: Euen ſo it followeth that what ſoeuer is written of the enemies of Chriſte, ſhoulde not only agrée, but alſo be fulfilled in the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of Chriſte. Héerevppon the Apoſtle Peter ſayth, <hi>Let his habitation be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerte, and no man be dvvelling therein.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Act. 1.20.</note>

                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 69.26</note> The whiche place he alleageth as ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of Iudas. The whiche Pſalme, and the hundred and nyne alſo, doo ſpecially intreate of the Lordes puniſhment, and of his enemies: notwithſtanding the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentes of them were firſt fulfilled in Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid as in the figure of Chriſte, and in his enemies, which were types of the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of Chriſte, but yet figuratiuely and truely fulfilled at the laſt in the Lorde, and in hys enemies.</p>
               <p>Héerevppon it ſéemeth that the Lorde ſpake in this preſent place of thoſe things which are written in the ſixtie nine Pſal. concerning his enemies.</p>
               <p>By this place alſo we are taught, that the holy Scripture can not be fruſtrate (euen as Chriſt taught in the tenth chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter gooing before.) And therefore thoſe thinges contayned in the ſame, whether they appertayne to the ſaluation of the Godly, or to the deſtruction of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate, are ſo certaynely to be belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, that wée néede nothing to doubte, but that they ſhall be ſaued to whome the ſame promiſeth ſaluation, and thoſe deſtroyed, to whome ſoeuer the ſame threatneth deſtruction.</p>

               <p>Fyrſte of all therefore hee prayethe that the Father woulde ſanctifie hys diſciples: that is too ſaye, that hee woulde whollye addiecte them vnto him, and take them too him ſelfe as a holie and principall charge.</p>

For if ſo be through the doctrine of the Goſpell we beléeue in Chriſt, there is no cauſe why we ſhould doubt but that with the Apoſtles we are vnder Gods protection, ſo that none of vs can periſhe. This praier of Chriſt is a quiet hauen, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the whiche whoſoeuer entereth, he is ſafe from all perill of ſhipwracke: for his wordes are of as great force as if he had ſolemly ſworne that he is carefull for our ſaluation. <hi>R.</hi> And firſte of all this place confirmeth the authoritie of the Apoſtles agaynſt thoſe which very contemptuouſly extinuate and diſprayſe the preaching of the Goſpell by the Apoſtles,<note place="margin">Prou. 20.9.</note> for that they were men alſo ſubiect vnto errours. And it is true that they were men in lyfe and in workes: (for who can ſay my harte is cleane?) but they preached the doctrine of the Goſpel, not by humaine, but by the diuine miniſterie. Wherevppon Chriſte alſo prayeth for thoſe which ſhoulde be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue through their preaching. Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more let our conſciences be confyrmed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynſt the worlde, and agaynſt all the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions of the worlde.

But let vs be aſſured that the ſame fayth onely is approued of the ſonne of God our Iudge alone, whiche is conceyued by the doctrine of the Apoſtles. For there ſhall no certayne teſtimonie any where elſe bee founde, than in their writinges. We muſte alſo note what fayth the word of the Apoſtles doth bring foorth.

               <p>
                  <hi>R.</hi> That which Chriſt prayed for his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, he nowe alſo prayeth for all the faythfull, that they might be of one fayth, of one ſpirite,<note place="margin">Ephe. 4.5.</note> and of one Baptiſme, and might acknowledge one Lorde. <hi>C.</hi> Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he prefixeth agayne the ſcope of our felicitie in vnitie: and not without cauſe. For this is the deſtruction of mankinde, that the ſame béeing drawen and fallen from God, is lame, diſperſed, and confoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in it ſelfe. Therefore the repayring therof is contrary, namely, that the ſame muſt grow togither into one body: euen as the Apoſtle Paule ſaith, <hi>He gaue ſome Apoſtles,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ephe. 4.13.</note>

Furthermore let vs know that this is the beginning of a happie life, if ſo be we all are gouerned and do liue by the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpirite of God.<note place="margin">Vnity is the gift of God.</note> 
                  <hi>M.</hi> But withall let vs remember that this vnitie commeth not but by the gifte of God. Therfore Chriſt prayeth the Father, that he woulde giue vnto them to be one. This gift is not got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten but by the ſpirite of God. The ſpirite of the fleſhe and of the worlde, is not the ſpirite of vnitie, but of diſcordes. <hi>R.</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the wicked there is not one fayth: for one beleeueth in his faſting, another in his ſacrifices, this fellow beleeueth in Sainct Nicholas, and that fellowe in Sainct Michaell: ſome in the bleſſed Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, and other ſome in Sainct Anne: and looke howe many men, ſo many Goddes there are among the wicked. Therefore the true vnitie is among Chriſtians only, which are of one ſpirite, whiche haue one Lorde, and one Sauiour. <hi>C.</hi> Moreouer we muſt note, that ſo often as Chriſt in this chapter pronounceth him ſelfe to be one with the Father, he ſpeaketh not ſimply of his deuine eſſence, but is called one in the perſon of a Mediator, in that he is our head. <hi>A.</hi> Sainct Iohn comprehendeth this coniunction, of the which Chriſt ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth heere in few words, ſaying:<note place="margin">1.

                  <hi>That vvhiche vvee haue ſeene and heard wee shew vnto you, that you alſo mighte haue fellowsippe with vs, and that our fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship may be with the Father, and wyth his ſonne Ieſus Chriſt.</hi>

But bicauſe throughout thys whole Chapter, by the world he meaneth the Reprobate, the contrary ſentence and opition is better allowed.

And this worde <hi>(Beleeue)</hi> is impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly put by the Euangeliſt, for the word <hi>(knovv)</hi> ſeeing the wicked béeing conuin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by experience it ſelfe, do vnderſtande and perceyue the heauenly and diuine glory of Chriſt. Thus it commeth to paſſe that in beleeuing they beléeue not: bicauſe this ſence and vnderſtanding dothe not pearch into the internall affection of the minde. And this is the iuſt iudgement and vengeance of God, that the eyes of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate ſhuld be blinded with the bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of his diuine glory, which are vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of his ſincere ſighte. <hi>R.</hi> Chriſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore prayeth his Father, that he woulde confyrme the faythfull in one ſpirite, that all the worlde may know that he came by deuine authoritie into this worlde. And this began fyrſt to be fulfilled,<note place="margin">Act. 4.32.</note> when by the ſending of the holy Ghoſt, the fayth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full

               <p>Therfore his Sermon and Prayer bée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ended, he went foorth with his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples ouer the brooke Cedron. <hi>M.</hi> Some thinke that this brooke was called the brooke of Ceders, bicauſe many Ceder trees grew about the ſame. <hi>C.</hi> But it is very like notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding, that this name came vp through error.

For he came not vnto this place without foreſight of that which folowed, ſéeing he was ignorant of nothing whiche was to come to paſſe. <hi>M.</hi> Wherefore Chriſt paſſing ouer the brooke Cedron, entred into the Garden, not to flée from his Perſecuters, but that he might go to that agony whiche was to come, according to Gods appoyntment.

Notwithſtanding this ſentence ſeemeth to be broughte out of order, whiche ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth rather to appertayne to mennes ſoules, than to their bodies. For Chriſte dydde ſaue and preſerue the Apoſtles in ſafetie (as touching their bodyes) to the ende: but he rather ſpake thys, that in the middeſt of continuall daungers, and in deathe it ſelfe, theyr eternall ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhoulde be in ſafetie. I aunſwere: The Euangeliſt ſpeaketh not ſimply of their corporall lyfe, but meaneth ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that Chriſt ſparing them for a time, prouided for their euerlaſting ſaluation. Let vs conſider howe greate theyr im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becilitie was as yet: What would they haue doone, thinke you, if they had béene broughte to the pinche?

But this woman rather ſuſpected that whiche was falſe, than that whiche was true, and foreſhewed by the Lord him ſelfe in playn wordes. She ſuſpected that he was remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to ſome other Sepulcher: when as he was neither in that nor in any other: but was riſen agayne. So in doubtfull mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters we rather fall into ſuſpition of that which is falſe, than of that which is true. <hi>Bv.</hi> Notwithſtanding by this complaynt it came to paſſe that occaſion was giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the Diſciples more diligently to ſearche out the truth. For therefore Mary Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalene tolde that vnto Peter and Iohn which ſhe vnderſtoode, that they mighte more narrowly diſcuſſe the whole mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.

               <p>
                  <hi>Bv.</hi> It ſeemeth that Mary, the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples beeing returned home, came agayne to the Sepulchre. For as ſhe ſtoode with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out at the doore of the Sepulchre, and did nothing els but weepe, after the maner of women, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> preſence of Angels which were in the ſepulcher, broughte to paſſe, that ſtouping downe ſhe might ſée into the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulcher: where ſhe ſaw two Angels with a ioyfull and glorious countenance, kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping that place where the body of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lord was layde. <hi>C.</hi> Wonderfull was the ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and goodnes of the Lorde, which for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaue Mary and hir fellowes ſo many vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. For he doth them no ſmall honour in ſending his Angels, and in manifeſting him ſelfe vnto them: the whiche was not grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted vnto the Apoſtles. For although the Apoſtles and the women were all in one fault, yet notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding theyr blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe was leſſe excuſable, who beeing ſo plainly taught, had profited ſo litle. Chriſt choſe the women, that he might fyrſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueale him ſelfe vnto them, not with ſhame to the Apoſtles. <hi>M.</hi> Notwithſtanding it is vncertayne whether Mary knew them to be Angels, yea or no, or whether ſhee thought them to be men. Moſt thinke that ſhe toke them for me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. But ſo often as we reade that Angels appeared in the vſible ſhew of men, and clothed in mens apparel, it was bicauſe of the groſſe rudeneſſe of men. Alſo there is no doubt but that they had ſometime true bodies giuen vnto them. But whether theſe two Angels had only the fourme of bodies, or no, it is ſuperfluous to enquire. It ſuffiſeth vs that the Lord gaue vnto them a humaine forme, in ſo much that the women coulde both ſee and heare them: but they were beautified ſo ſtraungely, that they ſeemed rather to be come from heauen, than from among men. <hi>Bv.</hi> And certaynely, God at this time had ordeyned theſe Angels to teſtifie of the reſurrection of the ſonne.</p>
               <q>The one at the head, &amp; the other at the feete.</q>
               <p>Whereas in Matthew we haue men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion made only of one Angell, it differeth nothing from the Narration of Iohn. For bothe ſpake not at once to Mary, but one of them to whome the meſſage was committed. <hi>C.</hi> And in that the Angels kéepe and watche this place, we haue to note that Chriſte thus began the glory of his kingdome. For in that the Angels honor his Sepulchre, the ignominy of the croſſe is not only therby taken away, but the Maieſtie of Chriſt alſo ſhineth.</p>

This ſpeach conteyneth both reprehenſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and conſolation.

But it is more likely that the fault was in the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans ſight: euen as it is ſayde of the two Diſciples in the <hi>.24.</hi> of Luke. Therefore let vs not ſay that Chriſte did alter and chaunge his face, as the Poets fayne of <hi>Proteus,</hi> who tranſformed him ſelfe into diuers ſhapes: but rather let vs ſay, that it is in the pleaſure and power of God, which hath giuen eyes vnto men, to daſel them, when it ſhall ſeeme good vnto him, that in ſéeing they might not ſée.

               <p>
                  <hi>M.</hi> The Euangeliſt in ſaying that Marie tourned hir ſelfe about againe, meaneth that ſhe tourned hir face again to the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulcher, whither peraduenture hir heart was bent. <hi>A.</hi> For ſhe had a feruent &amp; vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakeable deſyre to fynde the Lord: but ſo ſoone as ſhe heard and vnderſtoode the voice of her Shepeheard, ſhe biandby cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with great ioye and admiration, <hi>Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boni. C.</hi> Thus in Mary we haue depain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to vs the Image of our calling. For this is our only enteraunce into the true knowledge of Chriſt, if ſo be he know vs fyrſt, and do familiarlye call vs vnto him, not with that common voyce, which gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally ſoundeth in the eares of all men, but by which he doth ſpecially cal thoſe ſhepe which are geuen vnto him of the father. Hereuppon the Apoſtle <hi>Paule</hi> ſayth.<note place="margin">Gal. 4.9.</note> 
                  <hi>After that ye knew God, yea rather wer known of God.</hi> And the efficacie of the word ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth hereby, that Mary gaue biandby vnto Chriſt, that honour which was due vnto him. For y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> name of <hi>Rabboni</hi> is not only honorable, but contayneth alſo the profeſſion of obedience. Therefore Marye declareth her ſelf to be a diſciple of chriſt, and ſubmitteth her ſelfe vnto him as to a maiſter. This is a wonderfull and ſecret conuerſion of mans mynde, when God il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luminating the ſame by his holye ſpirite, maketh the ſame of blynde, ſodenly to ſée perfectly. The like example we haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt in the two diſciples which were go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Emaus. A.</hi> For when as at the fyrſt their eyes were held that they knew not Chriſt,<note place="margin">Luk. 24.30.</note> at the length when he toke bread, and bleſſed, and brake the ſame, their eies were opened, and they knew him whom before they iudged to be a ſtraunger.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>C.</hi> Furthermore the example of Marye ought to be an exhortation vnto vs, that ſo many as Chriſt calleth vnto him do an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer him preſently again without delay.</p>
               <p n="17">
                  <hi>17. Ieſus ſayth vnto her, touch me not, for I am not yet aſcended to my father: but goe to my brethren, and ſaye vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, I aſcend vnto my father, &amp; your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and to my god, &amp; your God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>B.</hi> Mary wold haue imbraſed Chriſt for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> exceding loue &amp; ioy which ſhe had, becauſe ſhe ſaw Chriſt preſent again in the fleſh. But when the Lord ſawe that ſhe won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered at his carnall preſence more than was mete, ſeking to lift vp her mynde to heauenly thinges, and to the imbracinges of faith, forbad her to touch him, ſaying:</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>C.</hi> Notwithſtanding this ſéemeth not to agree with the narration of <hi>Mathew.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 28.9.</note> For he plainlye writeth that the women im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braſed the féete of Chriſt.

them was iudged of them to be but a viſion,<note place="margin">Luk. 24.37</note> to the end they might beleeue the reſurrection, he ſayd, <hi>Feele and ſee, for a ſpirite hath not flesh and bones as ye ſee me haue.</hi> Alſo, Thomas had ſayde, <hi>Except I ſee the print of his nailes in his handes, and put my finger into the print of the nayles, and my hande into his ſide I will not beleue.</hi> Therfore Chriſt did very well in offering him ſelfe to be felte of him. <hi>A.</hi> But in Marye there was no ſuche doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, that there ſhould neede any further feeling: but it was requiſite that ſhe ſhuld come to a further faith, and to more plain vnderſtanding of the kingdome of Chriſt, leaſt ſhe ſhould abaſe him in cogitation more than there was cauſe. <hi>C.</hi> We muſt alſo note the reaſon which Chriſt addeth.</p>
               <q>For I am not yet aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to my Father.</q>
               <p>For by theſe wordes he commaundeth the woman to ſuſpend their affection, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till ſuche time as hee was aſcended into the glory of his kingdome. Furthermore he ſheweth the fayth of his reſurrection, not ſuch a faith as they imagined to them ſelues, as that when he was riſen againe he ſhould raigne &amp; triumphe in the world: but rather that by his aſcenſion into hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, he ſhold take poſſeſſion of that king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome which was promiſed vnto him, and ſitting at the right hande of his Father, might gouerne the Church by the power of his ſpirit. Therfore the ſence and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of his wordes is, that the ſtate of his reſurrection is not full and perfecte, vntill ſuch time as he ſit at the right hand of his Father in the kingdome of heauen. As if he ſhould ſay. <hi>B.</hi> Think not bicauſe ye ſée me preſente in the fleſh, that ye haue ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayned the fruition of all good thinges. I ſayd before vnto my diſciples, that it was good for them that I ſhould go vnto my Father, to whom when I had aſcended, I would ſend my ſpirite the comforter, and bring all things to paſſe for them. Theſe thinges ye ought to looke for, and not to make ſuch account of my corporall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence. Abſtaine therfore from this ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt touching, leſt ye be to much addicted to my carnal preſence: ye ought hereafter to imbrace me by faith, raigning in heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                  <hi>C.</hi> But this doctrine bringeth a double profit. The firſt is, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> al they which wil not erre in ſeeking Chriſt, muſt lift vp their minds to heauen. The ſecond is,<note place="margin">Col. 3.1.</note> y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> al they which come to him, muſt caſt off from the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> carnal affections, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as the Apoſtle <hi>Paule</hi> teacheth.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>M.</hi> Chriſt ſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth Mary vnto his Apoſtles, whom he calleth his brethren. For they wer ſons of the ſame God y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> father whoſe only begotten ſon he was. <hi>C.</hi> But the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtimable goodnes of Chriſt doth ſhine in this, that he ordaineth &amp; appointeth wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men to be witneſſes vnto the Apoſtles of his reſurrection. For y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Ambaſſage which is committed vnto them, is the only foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of our ſaluation, &amp; conteineth the principal point of heauenly wiſdom. How<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>beit we muſt alſo note that this was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary, and as it were accidentall.</p>
               <q>I aſcende vnto my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and your father.</q>
               <p>By the name of aſcending he confirmeth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> doctrine of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which we ſpake euen now: namely y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he therefore roſe againe, not to abide vppon the earth, but to enter into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> heauenly life, &amp; to drawe all the faithfull thither w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> him. Therefore ther is a great emphaſis &amp; force in this word, <hi>I aſcend,</hi> bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Chriſt reacheth his hande vnto his diſciples, leſt they ſhould ſeke felicitie in any other place then in heuen. For where our treaſure is, there alſo it is méete that our heart ſhuld bée. But Chriſt ſaith that he doth aſcend: therfore we alſo muſt aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend, except we wil be ſeperated fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him.<note place="margin">Mat. 6.21.</note> Moreouer when he ſaith that he doth aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſend to God, he doth put away all ſorow and griefe which the Apoſtles might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue by his deperture. For he geueth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to vnderſtand, that he will alway be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent by his deuine preſence, with thoſe that are his. By his aſſending the diſtance of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> places is noted. But although Chriſt be abſent in bodye, yet notwithſtanding bicauſe hée is God, hys power euerye where ſhed foorth, doth playnlye declare hys ſpirituall preſence. For to what end doth he aſcend vnto god, but only that
<pb n="593" facs="tcp:14631:303"/>
he ſitting at his right hande, might reigne in heauen, and in earth. <hi>M.</hi> Alſo this is to be noted, that he doth not onely ſay, I aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cende vnto my Father and my God, but added alſo, <hi>And to your Father, and your God.</hi> Therfore they which are Chriſtes, haue the ſame God, and the ſame Father that he hath. <hi>C.</hi> For this is an ineſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble benefite, that the faythfull may ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly truſte and beléeue, that the God of Chriſt is their God and Father alſo. This truſt, beeing founded vpon Chriſte, is no raſhneſſe. Moreouer Chriſte calleth the Father his God in reſpect of his humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, he hauing taken vpon him the fourme of a ſeruant. This therfore is proper to his humane nature: but yet it is refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the whole perſon in reſpecte of the vnitie: becauſe he is both God and man. We haue alſo here to note that Chriſt is the Sonne of God by nature, but we by adoption onely: but ſuche is the ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie of grace whiche we haue by him, that the diuell with all his force ſhall neuer be able to ſhake the ſame, but that we ſhall alwayes call him our Father, who hath adopted vs in his only begotten ſonne. <hi>A.</hi> Chriſte therefore is ſo called oure brother, that therewithall alſo wee muſt account him our Lord and Prince.</p>

And ſhe tolde vnto the Diſciples two things, according to the Lordes commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: The one is that ſhe ſhad ſeene the Lorde. She ſayth not that the Lord was ryſen, but that ſhe had ſeene him, that ſhe might bring tidings of that whiche was playne and euident. This was very ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie to be tolde vnto the Apoſtles, by hir, who before had made them ſuſpecte the remouing away of the Lordes body. The other is, that he ſayde vnto hir, <hi>Go vnto my brethren, and tell them, I aſcend vnto my father. &amp;c.</hi> Let vs conſider that it is not without cauſe that he commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Mary to tell the Diſciples, not only that he was riſen agayne, but alſo that he was about to aſcende into heauen to his Father.

               <q>When the doores were ſhut.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>M.</hi> The manner of this people was not to ſhut their doores in the day tyme. For this cauſe the Euangeliſt ſayth, that the Apoſtles came together in a ſecrete aſſembly beeing afearde of the fury and outrage of the Iewes. <hi>C</hi> And in that they came together, it was a ſigne of faith, or of Godly affection: but in that they ſhut vp them ſelues in ſecret, we do acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that there was ſome infirmitie in them. For the ſtouteſt and moſt valiant me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſometime are afrayd: but notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding we may perceiue that the Apoſtles were ſo afearde, that they bewrayed the infyrmitie of their fayth. <hi>R.</hi> The Apoſtles feared the Iewes as yet (bicauſe their harte was not yet ſealed with the ſpirite of God: but afterwarde, the ſpirite beeing reuealed, the doores were not onely ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, but alſo the Apoſtles preached Chriſt publiquely abroade, fearing neyther thretninges, nor death, nor hell, nor Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than, but deryded them euen as tryfles and ſporte. Of ſo greate power is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation of the holy Ghoſt. <hi>C.</hi> And we haue here an example worthy to be noted. For although the Apoſtles behaued not the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues ſo valiantly as it became the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding they did fauoure their infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie.

For otherwiſe they had béene diſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced here and there, and one of them woulde haue béene afrayde to looke an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other in the face. After the ſame manner muſt we fight with the infirmitie of our fleſhe, and reſiſte feare, which maketh vs to falle away. And Chriſte doth bleſſe their zeale in appearing to them béeing gathered together, and Thomas is iuſtly depriued of that grace which all his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> had, bicauſe as a vagrant or wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dring ſouldier he was departed from the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne of vnitie.

               <p>
                  <hi>M.</hi> In that Chriſte, when the doores were ſhut, came vnto his diſciples, which were gathered together for feare of the Iewes, to the ende, by his apparition he might comforte them béeing in griefe and feare, we haue a notable proofe of his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine power. For wheras ſome think that the doores were opened for him, that he might enter in according to the manner of men, it diſagréeth much with the mind of the Euangeliſt. Therefore we muſte not thinke that Chriſt entred in without miracle, to the ende he might declare hys diuine power, to make his Diſciples the more attentiue. Neuertheleſſe that is moſte falſe whiche the Papiſtes affirme, as, that Chriſtes body perced the doores which were ſhut. This they therefore af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyrme that they mighte make his glory<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied body not onely lyke vnto a ſpirite, but alſo ſo incomprehenſible that no place can contayne the ſame. But the woords of the Euangeliſt ſounde no ſuch thyng: by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he ſaith not that he entred through the doores that were ſhut: but that hée ſtoode ſodaynely in the middeſt of hys diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciplees when the doores were ſhutte. We knowe that Peter came foorthe of the faſt barred priſon: ſhal we therfore ſay that he perced through the middeſt of the Iron gate? This were to abſurde and childiſh: let vs co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tent our ſelues with this that Chriſt purpoſed by a notable miracle to confyrme the Apoſtles in the fayth of his reſurrection.</p>

For the lord did not ſend forth his Apoſtles, to offer them ſelues a ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice for the ſins of the whole world, nether to the ende the father might be called vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon through their name, or that by their merittes the whole worlde mighte bée ſaued,<note place="margin">Mat. 9.12.

Wherfore it is no maruayle if ſo be none be found fitte, but hee which is endued with the holye ghoſt.<note place="margin">1.

                  <hi>3. Symon Peter ſayth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, I go a fiſhing. They ſay vnto him, we alſo will go with thee. They went their way, &amp; entered into a ſhip im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly, and that night caught they nothing.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Bv.</hi> Here fyrſt is ſet downe the occaſion by which y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> manifeſtation was made. For when <hi>Symon Peter</hi> was come into hys owne countrey with his diſciples, leaſt hée ſhould be idle, and liue vpon other mens coſt and charge, went a fyſhing and tooke with him the reſt of his diſciples. <hi>C.</hi> And this trauayle of <hi>Peter</hi> in fyſhing oughte not to be iudged vnſéemely &amp; vnméete for his office. He was only ordayned an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle by breathing as yet, as we haue ſayde before in the twentie chapter: but he cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed for a little while vntil he were endued with new power. For he was not as yet commaunded to go forth to execute the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of teaching, but was only admoniſhed of his calling to come, that he and the reſt might know, that they were not choſen fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the beginning in vayne. In the meane tyme they do that which they were accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomed to do, and which became priuate men, vntill ſuch tyme as they were called of the lord to do other buſines. The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle <hi>Paule</hi> euen in the middeſt of his race of preaching got his liuing with his ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds: but he had another conſideration. For ſo the time gaue hym leaue, leaſt handy la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors might drawe him away from tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching. But <hi>Peter</hi> and his fellowes bicauſe they were frée from al publique function, gaue them ſelues wholly vnto fiſhing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bv.</hi> Therfore herein labour is commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to vs all, and idlenes condemned.</p>
               <q>And that night caught they nothing.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>M.</hi> In that they tooke nothing it ſéemeth to be ſo ordered by gods diſpoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment. <hi>C.</hi> For god had ſuffered the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to labor &amp; weary them ſelues in vaine al the night, to make y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> miracle more manifeſt. For if they had taken any thing, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> power of Chriſt would not ſo quickly and ſo eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentlye haue appeared: but laboring all the night in vain, &amp; then ſodenly incloſing a great multitude of fiſhes, they haue iuſt occaſion geuen them to acknowledge the grace of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> lord. <hi>Bv.</hi> By this place we are taught y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> all mans labour is in vaine, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> lord proſper &amp; bleſſe his endeuour. <hi>R.</hi> For ſo long as we labour w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out Chriſt, we labour in vaine. And this is the cauſe why they which oftentymes take moſt paynes are moſt poore. For they ſée not God in their labour. God is not ſéene but by the word. The father is not ſéene, but by the ſonne. What then ſaith the ſonne? The father clotheth thée, the father nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſheth thée. Therfore if by faith thou be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to labour in this word of the ſonne, thou ſhalt truly ſee god in thy labour, who will throughly bleſſe thée, &amp; whatſoeuer thou takeſt in hand it ſhall proſper. <hi>C.</hi> Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo God doth oftentimes exerciſe the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, euen as he hath don the Apoſtles, to commend vnto them his bleſſing. If ſo be alwayes all thinges which they take in hand ſhould haue good ſucceſſe, no man al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt wold impute y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fruit &amp; gain of his la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bleſſing of god: euery one would boaſt of his owne labour, &amp; kiſſe his owne hands: but when ſometyme they wearye the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out profite, if ſo be afterward any better fruit chaunce to come, they are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtrained to acknowledge ſomwhat that is extraordinary. Thus it co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth to paſſe that they begin to attribute the prayſe of proſperous ſucceſſe vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> grace of God.</p>

                  <hi>4 But when the morning was come, Ieſus ſtood on the ſhore: neuertheleſſe the diſciples knewe not that it was Ieſus. Ieſus ſaith vnto them, children haue ye any meate. &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bv.</hi> The diſciples knew not chriſt, either

And when hée aſketh them if they haue any meate hée meaneth fiſh. But the diſciples ſuppoſing that he had bene ſome other man which came to the lake to buy fyſhe, anſwered him, that they had nothing.</p>
               <p n="6">
                  <hi>6. And he ſaith vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, caſt out the net on the ryght ſyde of the ſhip and ye ſhall finde &amp;c.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>C.</hi> Chriſt commaundeth not as by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> right and authoritie of a Maſter, but geueth frendly aduice as one of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> people: <hi>M.</hi> And by this admonition hee prepareth away for the miracle. For it was neceſſary that they ſhuld haue this watch word before, that they might afterward know, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto they might referre this ſodayne and vnloked for multitude of fiſhes. And wheras Chriſt did not make the fyſhes of their owne accord to leape into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> diſciples Ship, but be rather would haue them to be taken by the incloſier of their net. By this image we are taught that the goſpell is néedfull to be preached euen among the elect, by the miniſtrie of the Apoſtles, that they may be ſaued. <hi>C.</hi> The diſciples not knowing what to do, and being without hope of fruite, eaſilye yelded to the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayle of him, whome they tooke to be a ſtraunger. If ſo bee any man had geuen them ſuche counſayle at the fyrſt pitch, they would not haue bene ſo ready to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baye, The which is therfore ſpoken, leaſt any man ſhould maruayle that they were ſo obedient, ſéeing they were ſo far ſpente with labour. Therefore, bicauſe they had taken nothing, they obeyed the worde of the Lord, though vnknowne vnto them, if peraduenture they might at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> laſt take ſome fiſh to carry home with them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>C.</hi> Howbeit this is no commen example of ſufferaunce and patience, that they con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tinue their labour after the day lighte, which they had ſpent without profite all y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> might. And verely if ſo be we ſubmit our ſelues to the bleſſing of him, we muſt pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently wayte for the ſame. For ther is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more vnméete than bi andby to pull back our hand from our labour, if it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pere not profytable. The nakednes of <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> teſtifieth that the Apoſtles had labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red very ſore, and yet notwithſtanding they let not to caſt in their net a freſhe, that they might omit no occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtanding in that they obeyed the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement of Chriſt it cannot be aſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed vnto faith. For they heard him as a ſtraunger. Now if ſo be at any tyme our vocation ſéemeth yrkeſome, bicauſe our labour and trauayle is without fruite, yet notwithſtanding when the Lord ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horteth vs to go forewarde, let vs be of good chéere, we ſhall haue at the laſt good ſucceſſe in due tyme.</p>

                  <hi>7. Then ſayd the diſciple whom Ieſus loued, it is the lord. When Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Peter heard that it was the lord, he gyrt hys coate vnto hym, (for he was naked, and ſprang into the ſea.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>M.</hi> This diſciple beloued of Ieſus was Iohn, who wrote theſe thinges. Hée was the fyrſt which knew the Lord, by the incloſing of the wonderfull companye of fyſhes, of whom he enformed Peter al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo. <hi>R.</hi> Therfore it appereth for what cauſe they had taken nothing all the night long, and afterwards drew a great multitude of fiſhes into the Ship, namely, for no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cauſe than that they might thereby the more plainly know the Lord: euen as oftentimes our praiers ſéeme to be vaine, if ſo be anye thing contrary vnto our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyre happen. And with this purpoſe the
<pb n="608" facs="tcp:14631:310"/>
Lord doth work contrary to our prayers, that he may afterward more fully grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t vs the petitions of our hearts, &amp; may be more largely glorifyed in vs. Moreouer the Euangeliſt by his example teacheth, that when we haue good ſucceſſe contrary to our expectation, wee muſt lift vp our myndes vnto the Lord: bicauſe we ought biandby to remember, that this benefyte procéeded from his grace, which is the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of all goodnes. This godly knowledge of the deuine grace which <hi>Iohn</hi> had in his mynde, brought him to the knowledge of Chriſt alſo. For he knew not Chriſt with his bodely eyes, but bicauſe he was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded that this aboundance of fyſh was geuen vnto them of God, hee gathereth that it was Chriſt which directed theyr handes.</p>

               <p>As faith was fyrſt in <hi>Iohn,</hi> ſo <hi>Peter</hi> biand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by excelleth him in feruencie of the ſpirit, when ſetting all feare of perill aſyde, hée caſteth him ſelf into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> lake. <hi>R.</hi> For Chriſt being knowne, no daunger is feared.</p>
               <p>

Let it ſuffyce vs to know this, that he leauing the ſhip tooke his way, not raſhlye, but according to the meaſure of his zeale, that hee might come before the reſt vnto Ieſu. <hi>M.</hi> Moreouer in that hée being naked gyrded his coate vnto hym when he came out of the Ship to Chriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde, it is an example of ſhamefaſtnes and reuerence.

Thus al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the Lord fed the Iſraelites in the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernes, who following their vocation had bread from heauen, quailes brought with the wynd, and water out of the rock. <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> following the calling of the Lord in the mountayne, was nouriſhed fortie dayes without bread or water. <hi>Elias</hi> following his calling was fed by a Rauen, by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture a rauenous bird.

But it ſéemeth to be the more ſimple ſence and meaning, if ſo be thou vnderſtande that Peter was aſked, whether he loued the Lorde more ferue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly than did the reſt. Peraduenture the queſtion roſe herehence, for that he leauing his felowes in the Skiffe, caſt him ſelfe into the lake, not tarying the time of rowing, and ſeeking to come firſt vnto the Lord ſtanding vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ſhore.

To the wreſting of the word of Chriſt this appertayned, bicauſe they abſolutely pronounced, that <hi>Iohn</hi> ſhould abyde in his preſent ſtate, vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>till Chriſt came againe: whereas he ſpake conditionally, <hi>If I will haue him tary till I come, what is that to thee.

So that of it ſelfe it was a ſimple and profy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table doctrine: but the diſciples deuiſe and imagine more than was ſpoken.
